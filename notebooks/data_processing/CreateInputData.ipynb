787\\t20314583\\tMs. ___ presented to the emergency room with jaundice and RUQ \\npain.  GI, transplant nephrology, and transplant surgery were \\nconsulted. She was febrile to 102 and slightly tachycardic.  RUQ \\nultrasound found a Common bile duct is dilated up to 1.7 cm in \\ndiameter, intrahepatic biliary dilation, and gallstones without \\nevidence of cholecystitis. Given her labs and presentation, the \\nfinding was most consistent with cholangitis. BCx from the day \\nof presentation grew corynobacterium diptherium, anaerobic gram \\npositive cocci, and gram positive rods.\\n\\nShe was admitted to the transplant surgery service for workup \\nunder Dr. ___ was started on IV unasyn.  GI did an ERCP \\nwith sphincterotomy, CBD stone removal, and placed a stent on \\nHD2.  In the next 2 days, the LFT\\'s continued to rise, so she \\nwas taken back on HD4 for another ERCP, which found a patent \\nstent and minimal sludge. The GI team did not appreciate any \\nevidence of obstruction at that time.  The day after that \\nprocedure, her LFT\\'s started to decrease and continued \\ndecreasing until the time of discharge. By HD5, she was doing \\nbetter and consuming a regular diet. She was still on IV pain \\nmedications as she continued to have some pain, which gradually \\nimproved until she was switched to PO pain meds on HD6. She also \\nhad some diarrhea that day, but a c. diff study was negative. \\n\\nShe remained on her home medications throughout her hospital \\nstay, including the cyclosporine and the mycophenolate mofetil. \\nCyclosporine levels were checked daily and were typically \\nwithint the normal range.\\n\\nOn HD8, the laboratory thought that the corynobacterium was \\nactually just a contaminant, and so she was switched to \\nAugmentin to complete another 7 days of antibiotics. Since she \\nwas likely quite inflamed and a cholescystectomy would be \\ntechnically very difficult during the admission, the team \\nplanned to schedule an interval cholecystectomy as an \\noutpatient.\\n\\nFollow up BCx and UCx were negative or negative to date by the \\ntime of discharge on HD9.  At the time of discharge, she was \\neating a regular diet, tolerating her pain with PO pain meds, \\nand not having any nausea or vomiting.  She was ambulating and \\nvoiding on her own without any difficulty. She was afebrile at \\nthe time of discharge.                                                \\t___ is a 67 year old F presenting to the ED with Abd pain, Back pain, Jaundice. Over the course of her hospital course, ___ started at Emergency Department and then visited Med/Surg, Transplant. Over the course of their hospital stay, her was given the following diagnoses: Cholangitis, Acute pancreatitis, Other chronic pulmonary heart diseases, Kidney replaced by transplant, Hemorrhage complicating a procedure, Edema, Other hyperparathyroidism, Esophageal reflux, Bipolar disorder, unspecified, Tachycardia, unspecified, Other specified disorders of biliary tract, Calculus of bile

30.0-30.9, adult, Other specified surgical operations and procedures causing abnormal patient reaction, or later complication, without mention of misadventure at time of operation, Accidents occurring in residential institution, Unspecified essential hypertension in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures: Endoscopic insertion of stent (tube) into bile duct, Endoscopic removal of stone(s) from biliary tract, Endoscopic sphincterotomy and papillotomy, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP] in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also

He is now s/p \\nplacement of a pigtail drain in ___.\\nCultures from the abscess and ___ admission blood cultures grew \\nFusobacterium nucleatum. He is on empiric CTX/flagyl with plan \\nfor at least a four-week course.\\n\\n#Liver abscess\\n#Sepsis (tachycardia, fevers)\\n#Bacteremia with Fusobacterium nucleatum\\n   Imaging initially felt to be concerning for malignancy, but \\nwhen patient underwent drainage ___ purulent material was \\naspirated with GNRs, supporting diagnosis of abscess. Cultures \\nfrom the abscess and ___ admission blood cultures grew \\nFusobacterium nucleatum. He was started on vanc/unasyn ___, \\nchanged to\\nzosyn ___, CTX/flagyl ___. He is on empiric CTX/flagyl at \\ndischarge with plan for at least a four-week course after first \\nnegative blood culture.  Midline was placed and he will follow \\nup with ID.\\n   Source of the infection is unclear. Bacteremia from an occult \\ndental abscess with hematogenous seeding is considered, and he \\nis encouraged to get a dental checkup. Seeding through the \\nportal vein is considered and his PCP is asked to arrange a \\ncolonoscopy, followed by further endoscopic workup as needed. \\n\\n#Microcytic anemia\\n   Lab picture consistent with anemia of inflammation, which \\nwould fit with the timeframe of his weight loss and suspected \\ninfection. The initial drop from\\n8.4 -> 6.7 was most likely equilibration after presenting in a \\ncontracted state and receiving IV fluids. No evidence for active \\nbleed. He declined transfusion, but Hgb recovered to 7.2 with \\ntreatment of his infection. \\n\\n#Question of underlying malignancy\\n  Weight loss of ~45 lbs, new anemia, and nonspecific \\nenlargement of spleen and LNs could all be explained by the \\nabscess, but malignancy is still suspected. As above, he needs \\ncolonoscopy as an outpatient. Likely repeat CT chest/abdomen in \\n4 weeks. If suspicious LAD persists could consider PET scan to \\nidentify a good biopsy\\ntarget (by size and location alone, the easiest biopsy target \\nwould likely be a R paratracheal node that appears accessible by \\nendobronchial approach). \\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n- at least 4 weeks of CTX/Flagyl\\n- per ID, he should get weekly Cr, BUN and CBC w/ diff while on \\nantibiotics. Gave him an Rx for labs. \\n- suggest repeat CT chest/abdomen in 4 weeks to assess for \\nresolution of the abscess, as well as suspicious LAD. If there \\nare residual abnormalities, consider biopsy.\\n- patient was asked to get a dental checkup with x-rays, in case \\nthe source of entry was an occult dental abscess. \\n- needs colonoscopy; if negative, consider EGD and capsule vs \\nMRE.\\n- discharged with abscess drain in place; a follow up \\nappointment with ___ for drain pull has been requested but not \\nscheduled ___ scheduler is ___ at \\n___.

In the ED, patient underwent \\nCT scan which was concerning for colitis in a vascular \\ndistribution, most likely concerning for an ischemic type \\ncolitis. Patient was evaluated by both the Gastroenterology and \\nAcute Care Surgical (ACS) service, at which point patient was \\nadmitted to medicine for further workup. Other differential \\ndiagnoses included infectious type colitis, and therefore stool \\nstudies were sent for microbial etiologies including C. diff, E. \\nColi O157:H7, and stool culture. Patient was empirically started \\non IV Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole to ensure coverage of \\nthese organisms, and C. diff returned negative. Further, it was \\ndiscussed that patient\\'s imaging may be consistent with \\nulcerative colitis, however thought to be less likely given no \\ninvolvement of the rectum, and vascular distribution of disease. \\nTherefore, it was recommended that patient undergo serial \\nabdominal exams, bowel rest, IVF, and was pain controlled. \\nThroughout hospital stay, patient continued to have severe \\nabdominal pain requiring IV hydromorphone for symptomatic \\nrelief, and patient continued to have bouts of melena and \\nhematochezia. Patient was evaluated daily by the ___ and GI \\nservices, and over the hospital stay, patient continued to have \\nnon-recovery of pain symptoms, and abdominal exam remained \\ncontinously out of proportion. Therefore, given slower clinical \\nrecovery and unchanging abdominal exams, patient underwent a \\ndedicated CTA scan which revealed unchanged colonic wall \\nthickening, edema in the transverse colon, inflmmatory fat \\nstranding consistent with an ischemic etiology . Further, ___ \\nand SMA remained patent, and no pneumatosis, gas, free fluid or \\nair was seen. Patient continued to have non-improvement in \\nclinical symptoms and pain, and given prolonged course of \\nabdominal pain without much relief, patient underwent flex \\nsigmoidoscopy on ___, which revealed mild proctitis with \\nnormal colonic mucosa type for 50 cm of exam. Biopsy of colonic \\nmucosa also consistent with ischemic type injury as well, and \\ntherefore given normal appearing colonic mucosa on \\nsigmoidoscopy, patient was trialed on diet on ___. Given \\nbiopsies consistent with ischemic type injury, patient completed \\na 7 day course of IV Cipro/Flagyl, and pain control was weaned \\nto oral medications, with advancement of diet. Patient tolerated \\nfood on ___, however then developed again worsening abdominal \\npain. KUB at that time did not reveal any signs of obstruction, \\nperforation, free air, and lactate 1.5. Therefore, unclear \\npicture given no signs of ischemia on laboratory values. Patient \\nwas started on oral dicyclomine per GI recommendations to help \\nwith pain, and thought that patient may have component of hyper \\nalgesia given prior pain clinic history. Patient was given IVF, \\nIV hydromorphone for symptomatic relief, and then trialed on \\ntransition back to PO oxycodone. Patient continued to have \\nepisodes of melanotic stools, however discussed with GI that not \\nuncommon given injury. However, as acute care surgery still \\nconcerned for possible missing other etiologies, patient \\nunderwent a colonoscopy on ___. Findings from colonoscopy \\ninclude diffuse continous ulceration, granularity, friability \\nand pseudopolyps with congestion, compatability with colitis \\nmost likely ___ to underlying ischemia. Patient also had several \\nsessile polyps ranging in size, and therefore would require \\ncolonoscopy for screening purpose in several months. Patient \\ncontinued to have abdominal pain, although improving, however \\nwas not improving at rate consistent with ischemic colitis. To \\nfurther evaluate, patient underwent a repeat CT scan which \\nshowed interval improvement in his colitis, without perforation, \\nand therefore surgical intervention was not indicated. Patient \\nto continue conservative management with pain control and \\nfollow-up with ACS in 2 weeks for further evaluation. \\n.\\n# Left Ulnar Neuropathy: Patient with past history of ulnar left \\nneuropathy, however no changes in past pain regimen. Patient was \\ncontinued on home gabapentin. Of note, patient has had several \\nepisodes of neuropathic pain requiring pain clinic at ___. \\nHowever, patient eventually was referred to other specialists \\nfor chronic pain complaints. \\n.  \\n# Asthma, controlled: Continued on albuterol PRN while \\ninpatient. \\n. \\n# Tobacco Cessation: Given ischemic type injury, discussed with \\npatient need for smoking cessation. Patient was very interested \\nin this, and was started on nicotine patch while inpatient, to \\nbe continued while outpatient. \\n. \\n# Insomnia/Depression: Patient was continued on home \\namitriptyline while inpatient. \\n. \\n>> TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  \\n# Ischemic Colitis: OK for patients to continue to have mild \\nepisodes of melena as colon mucosa recovering. Patient to have \\nfull colonoscopy as both nvestigatory and screening (age ___, \\nfound to have polyps on colonoscopy while inpatient) at follow \\nup appointment. Will need follow up in 2 weeks with ACS\\n# Pain Regimen: Prescribed 5 mg Oxycodone q ___ hours x 24 tabs \\n; also given dicyclomine anti-spasmodic to take short term\\n# Smoking Cessation: Encouraged, and patient was prescribed \\nnicotine patch 21 mcg (please taper as outpatient)\\n# HIV Test negative while inpatient.                                                \\t___ is a 47 year old M presenting to the ED with Diarrhea, Abd pain.

Initial blood work showed an elevated white \\nblood cell count.   Upon admission, the patient was made NPO, \\ngiven intravenous fluids, and underwent imaging. Cat scan \\nimaging showed a perforated Meckel\\'s diverticulum 6.6 x 3.8 x \\n3.8cm, local fat stranding, and thickening of the surrounding \\ntransverse colon. The patient was started on ciprofloxacin and \\nflagyl and operative preparations were undertaken. The patient \\nwas taken to the operating room where he underwent a \\nlaparoscopic Meckel\\'s diverticulectomy.  The operative findings \\nwere notable for an acutely-hyperemic and inflamed-thickened \\ndiverticulum on an anti-mesenteric border of the small bowel.\\nNecrosis was noted at the base, and free perforation at the tip \\nwith leakage\\nof enteric contents. The operative course was stable with \\nminimal blood loss.  The patient was extubated after the \\nprocedure and monitored in the recovery room.  \\n\\nThe post-operative course was stable.  The patient\\'s foley \\ncatheter was removed 24 hours after surgery and the patient \\nvoided without difficulty. A nsso-gastric tube was placed for \\nbowel decompression after the patient was noted to have \\nincreased abdominal distention.  The patient\\'s surgical pain was \\ncontrolled with intravenous analgesia.  On POD #5, the patient \\ncontinued to have abdominal distention and underwent an x-ray of \\nthe abdomen which showed dilated loops of small bowel.

Patient grew ___ parapsilosis in 2 sets of \\nblood cultures from PICC line (PICC Line was removed with \\nnegative tip culture however). ID was consulted. Besides the \\nPICC additional possible sources included urinary (also grew in \\nurine), seeded renal stone, itnraabdominal (NG on ascetic \\nfluid), and endocarditis. Patient was started on micafungin. TTE \\nshowed no vegetations. TEE was deferred in the setting of high \\nrisk procedure and multiple medical comorbidities. Ophthalmology \\nwas consulted and exam showed no signs of endogenous \\nendophthalmitis in the Right eye but the left eye could not be \\nevaluated due to dense cataract. He was transitioned from \\nMicafungin to Fluconazole as felt to have better penetration for \\nurinary infection. He had a new PICC line placed on ___. On \\n___ he had a new blood culture showing growth of likely the \\nsame ___. After discussion with ID, the decision \\nwas made to keep the PICC in place (until completion of IV abx \\ncourse as below on ___, then remove) and continue treatment \\nwith Fluconazole 200mg indefinitely given this is second \\nsystemic fungal infection and that it was not possible to r/o an \\nongoing seeded sight of infection (such as endocarditis or renal \\nstone)\\n\\n# Ethics/___. Ethics team was consulted for concern that the \\nhealthcare proxy was refusing to respond to phone calls and \\nasked to be contacted as little as possible. Ethics team \\nrecommended continuing treatment as long as not inhumane or \\ncausing suffering per the ___ \"Policy on Interventions that \\nare Ineffective or\\nHarmful.\" The recommendation was \"If at any time the responsible \\n___ attending\\ndetermines that a potential intervention -- such as attempting \\nCPR in the event of cardiac arrest -- would \"cause likely \\nsuffering or other risk of harm that grossly outweighs any \\nrealistic medical benefit to the patient\", then the attending\\nshould enter a DNAR order in the medical record AND inform that \\ndaughter/HCP of that, and the reasons for it.  If the daughter \\nobjects, then she has a right to a second opinion [from a \\nphysician not actively engaged in the patient\\'s care.]\" \\nFurthermore, \"If specific decisions need to be made for which it \\nis not\\nentirely clear from previous discussions with a health care \\nproxy what the patient himself would want, then for the health \\ncare proxy to be involved s/he must be both able and willing to \\nparticipate in discussions at least to the extent that would be\\nexpected of the patient if he were able to make his own \\ndecisions. If the health care proxy is unable or unwilling to do \\nthat, then she should be informed that in the absence of an \\nappropriately-engaged proxy the clinical team will be required \\nto\\nconsult the Ethics Support Service and possibly seek a \\ncourt-appointed guardian.\"\\n\\nDecision was made to make patient DNAR based on clinical \\ndecision making based on medical futility. Attempts were made to \\nupdate the daughter about this decision but she would not return \\ncalls and her voicemail box was full. \\n\\n# Chronic respiratory failure s/p trach, ventilation. \\n# VAP, presumed MDR Pseudomonas \\nPatient presented with chronic trach/vent, without s/s \\nrespiratory distress. Initial sputum cultures grew MDR \\npseudomonas, thought to represent colonization. 1 week into \\nadmission patient developed fever with CXR concerning for \\nconsolidation. Repeat sputum demonstrated MDR Pseudomonas. In \\nthe setting of fever, he was initiated on treatment for presumed \\nPseudomonas VAP with Tobramycin and Ceftolozane/Tazobactan at \\nthe direction of the ID consulting service. This will be \\ncontinued for 8 day course to end on ___, after which PICC \\nline should be discontinued.   \\n\\n# Abdominal distention. He was sent in for evaluation of \\nincreased abdominal distention over past several days while at \\n___. CT A/P in ED notable for non obstructive bowel pattern, \\ne/o likely urinary infection and ?acute bladder injury. Etiology \\nof distention difficult to discern. Ascites fluid was sampled \\nmultiple times during admission with PMN <250 but with increased \\nTNC count concerning for possible SBP. He was treated with broad \\nspectrum GN coverage as above for presumed VAP. His PEG tube was \\nreplaced on ___ by ___.  \\n\\n# Cirrhosis, etiology cryptogenic. Dx during ___ by \\nUS/CT imaging, new ascites and s/s portal HTN. Unclear variceal \\nstatus. No h/o HE or SBP. Etiology of cirrhosis unclear; \\nnegative hepatitis w/u, no reported ETOH abuse, AMA, ___ \\nnegative. Anti-Smooth muscle positive raising concern for \\nautoimmune etiology but low titer 1:40 less clinically \\nsignificant. Paracentesis with > ___ nucleated cells but did \\nnot meet criteria for SBP.  \\n\\n# Hypercalcemia. Ca ___, corrected to 11 based on albumin 3.2. \\nW/u for hypercalcemia during ___ notable for low PTH and \\nelevated PTH-rp (28, ULN 27 on in house assay). PTH was \\nappropriately low. \\n\\n# CKD. Admission Cr 2.9, decreased from discharge Cr 3.4 on \\n___. Medications were renally dosed. Creatinine on discharge \\nwas 2.6. \\n\\n# Anemia, macrocytic. Admission Hgb 8.8, stable from discharge \\nvalue from ___. No acute s/s bleeding. \\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES \\n================= \\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 200mcg daily\\n# HFpEF: Continued PO Lasix 40mg \\n# IDDM: Continued glargine/regular SS with TFs\\n# GERD: Continued omeprazole\\n# Glaucoma: Continued home eyedrops \\n# History of CVA: Not on ASA or statin\\n# A-fib: No longer on anticoag per past d/c summary records \\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n====================\\n- Fluconazole 200mg daily via PEG tube to be continued \\nindefinitely in the setting of recurrent candidemia. \\n- Continue IV antibiotics (Ceftolozane/Tazobactan and \\nTobramycin) to complete total ___nding on ___.\\n-- Ceftolozane/Tazobactan 375mg q8 \\n-- Tobramycin. To be dosed based on level. Please draw \\ntobramycin level at 9pm on ___. If level is <1 then given 1x \\ndose of 160mg IV.

Additionally, most \\nrecent cystoscopy in urology office was concerning for bladder \\nrecurrence. After discussing with outpatient oncologist Dr. \\n___ oncology consult service concluded there was no \\nrole for inpatient chemotherapy. Venting Gtube was subsequently \\nplaced to alleviate symptoms in the absence of surgery.

IUC was placed at ___, \\nbut this was removed on ___ admission and she tolerated a \\nvoiding trial - however she continued to have small volume \\nhematuria. Urology was consulted but recommended no intervention \\nin the absence of obstructive urinary symptoms. H/H remained \\nstable and serial bladder scans were without urinary retention. \\nVitamin K was given to reduce malnutrition-related elevated INR \\nin an attempt to slow bleeding. She was transfused 1u PRBC for \\nHb 6.8 during this admission. \\n\\n# Acute renal failure:  History, exam, and labs were suggestive \\nof hypovolemic, prerenal etiology. On admission to ___, her  Cr \\nwas 4.6. Felt to be related to hypovolemia, prerenal etiologies \\nand treated with IVF. Nephrology consulted.

It was determined that there was no \\nneed for 1:1 or ___ per admission evaluation. Per psych \\nconsult, she does seem depressed in context of cancer, though \\nthey also noted fatigue and low energy as contributors. Psych \\nrecommended Ritalin but this was not started this admission \\npending GOC and palliative options at ___. Would recommend \\npersistent psych involvement at ___, and consideration of \\nRitalin initiation.\\n\\n# Leukocytosis: Her leukocytosis had resolved, then had a mild \\nbump to 12.4 on ___. It is likely reactive in the setting of \\nthe small bowel obstruction and/or malignancy. We followed the \\nmicrobiology results and treated possible bacteremia with \\nvancomycin.\\n\\n# Severe protein calorie malnutrition: She is very cachectic. \\nNutrition was recommending TPN, however PICC placement and TPN \\ninitiation was held because of initial concerns for bacteremia\\n\\n# Insomnia: Her home lorazepam and rameleon were continued.\\n\\n# Crohn\\'s colitis: Previously complicated by colovesicular \\nfistula s/p bowel resection/fistula repair with ileostomy.

Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Emergency Department and then visited Medicine/Cardiology, Medicine. Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Atrial fibrillation, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Asthma, unspecified type, unspecified, Obstructive sleep apnea (adult)(pediatric), Anxiety state, unspecified, Posttraumatic stress disorder, Other and unspecified hyperlipidemia, Chronic kidney disease, unspecified, Obesity, unspecified, Esophageal reflux, Gout, unspecified, Long-term (current) use of steroids, Personal history of pneumonia (recurrent) in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures:  in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications:\\n 4940\\t 4940\\t20377597\\tASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ presenting from OSH s/p cardiac arrest x2 \\nafter altercation with police and positive urine amphetamines \\nnow with mixed post-cardiac arrest distributive and cardiogenic \\nshock, hypercarbic respiratory failure, renal failure, shock \\nliver, and DIC requiring 4-pressor support and CMV ventilation.  \\n\\n\\n#Shock - Requiring maxed Dobutamine, levo, epi gtt post cardiac \\narrest after altercation with police surrounding amphetamine \\nuse. According to toxicology, Arrest can follow due to an \\nacidosis that can develop with isometric muscle activity while \\nin restraints. This acidosis can get worse with continued muscle \\nactivity and agitation leading to subsequent arrests. He had a \\npost arrest distributive shock picture with CVP of 12 in ED and \\ncentral venous o2 55.  Bedside ECHO by cards showed poor windows \\nbut with better cardiac function s/p dobutamine w/ EF30% on \\nprelim report. Not a candidate for ECMO ___ DIC. Pt has a \\nleukocytosis to 26 with SIRS criteria that is felt to be stress \\nresponse; no focal consolidations on chest xray and UA negative, \\nfelt unlikely to be septic shock. Received Vanc/Zosyn in ED. \\nBlood Cultures drawn in ED. In the MICU, he was given an amp of \\nbicarb, D50 for FSG of 70, and Vasopressin started for MAPS in \\n___ after the team maxed out on Neo. His lactate continuned to \\nrise despite max 4 pressor therapy. He then became bradycardic \\nto 40. .5 amp of Atropine given. Pt become asystolic brifely \\nbefore regaining a pulse for ___ minutes. He developed a wide \\ncomplex rhythm without a pulse and PEA arrested.     \\n\\n#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - In the setting of decreased \\ndrive from drug OD, increased CO2 production from amphetamine OD \\nand agitation while retrained. Pt not requiring sedation. Pt at \\nRR of 30; however, end tital CO2 is low indicating possible poor \\ncardiac output/cirulation and thus increasing the RR may not \\nimprove CO2 parameters. Intubated and on vent. \\n\\n#DIC - Likey ___ to Amphetamine OD (direct cause of DIC). No \\nevidence of trauma or sepsis. Treatment of underlying causing \\nincludes clearance of drugs by kidneys and liver, both of which \\nwere imparied/failed.

persisted despite treatment with trial of \\nDoxycycline and 7-day course of Levofloxacin outpatient. She had \\na CT chest which identified mild upper lobe ground glass \\nopacities of unclear significance. Pulmonology was consulted who \\nfelt they were most consistent with resolving infection from her \\nprior outpatient treatment. They did not feel it represented an \\nuntreated infection or flare of her interstitial lung disease. \\nRecommended no further antibiotics, continuing outpatient \\nprednisone, and supportive treatment for cough symptoms. Also \\ntreated for UTI.\\n\\n==================== \\nACUTE ISSUES: \\n==================== \\n#Cough\\n#Fever\\n#GGO on CT chest\\nPatient underwent CT identifying GGO likely representing \\ninflammatory process vs. infection. The patient was afebrile \\nduring this admission and her DOE and cough seemed to be \\nresolving. Imaging was not consistent with acute bacterial \\nprocess, although atypicals could not be ruled out. Pulmonology \\nconsulted and felt findings were consistent with a \\npost-infectious cough. She was treated initially with \\nVanc/cefepime in the ED but this was discontinued after \\nrecommendations from pulmonology. Additionally, she was \\ncontinued on outpatient prednisone 5mg daily. Azithromycin 250mg \\ndaily prophylaxis was resumed as this had been discontinued \\nduring outpatient antibiotics therapy. Patient also treated with \\nfluticasone, and atrovent. Given PET/CT was performed during \\nsuspected pulmonary infection, results are difficult to \\ninterpret, and we recommend repeat in 3 months. Urinary strep \\npneumo and legionella were negative. Her ambulatory oxygenation \\nimproved during her hospital course.\\n\\n#UTI\\nPatient reported dysuria, suprapubic tenderness and red-tinged \\nurine. A UA was positive for pyuria with cultures showing no \\ngrowth. Patient was treated briefly with Cefepime and then \\nCeftriaxone but symptoms persisted. Repeat UA with no pyuria but \\npositive for nitrites. Antibiotics were discontinued and repeat \\nurine culture results pending. If the culture is positive, will \\ncontact patient about initiating treatment. If sx persist, \\nplease consider further workup\\n\\n#___\\nPatient reported one incident of a small amount of bright red \\nblood with wiping. She has a history of constipation and her \\nsymptoms were thought to be ___ anal fissure or hemorrhoid. She \\nwas put on a bowel regimen to prevent constipation and her BMs \\nwere monitored with no subsequent bleeding. Outpatient follow-up \\nrecommended if this recurs. \\n\\n==================== \\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \\n==================== \\n#Interstitial pneumonia\\nCT scan demonstrated stable fibrotic changes but with evidence \\nof GGOs, consistent with inflammatory vs. infectious process. \\nGiven her underlying NSIP, follow-up with Dr. ___ is \\nrecommended as an outpatient.\\n\\n#Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma\\nIncomplete ABVD therapy due to side effects. Recent PET scan \\nwith multifocal areas of increased FDG avidity bilaterally, \\ncould be ___ infectious/inflammatory process as described above. \\nCannot rule out malignancy. Recommend repeat PET/CT in 3 months \\nas outpatient. Follow up with Dr. ___\\n\\n==================== \\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \\n==================== \\n[] Patient had several episodes of BRBPR on admission which then \\nstopped. Unclear etiology although suspect hemorrhoids, would \\nconsider further workup if this is ongoing\\n[] Patient had an episode of loose stools with no infectious \\nsymptoms. If continuing to have these, would consider C. Diff \\ntesting\\n[] Recommend repeat PET/CT in 3 months as recent PET scan with \\nmultifocal areas of increased FDG avidity\\n[] Patient on home acyclovir as prescribed by ___ \\n___, NP (Hematology/Oncology). It was unclear to the \\ninpatient team whether this is needed indefinitely, please \\ndiscuss with heme/onc.\\n[] Treated for UTI given pyuria and dysuria though culture was \\nnegative, repeat UA without pyuria. If sx persist please workup \\nfurther.                                                \\t___ is a 76 year old F presenting to the ED with Cough, Dyspnea, Fever.

Etiology unclear at this \\ntime; LP finding of RBCs was concerning for possible HSV \\nencephalitis (definitely was not a traumatic tap per \\ninterventional radiology) and pt reports recent mouth sores, \\nhowever HSV PCR came back negative. However he was started on \\nacyclovir empirically (IV) on ___ after the finding of RBCs in \\nCSF was noted. This was subsequently discontinued. There was not \\nmuch to suggest systemic infection either- certainly he appeared \\nclinically too well for a bacterial meningitis and had no fevers \\nor nuchal rigidity. He never received antibiotics. There was no \\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage seen on head CT or brain MRI and no \\nxanthochromia in the CSF either to suggest such. Neurology was \\nconsulted and felt it was fine for him to be discharged without \\nan anti-epileptic to follow nonurgently with them in their \\nclinic. The exact etiology of the seizure was unclear, and EEG \\nshowed no seizure activity raising the possibility it was not a \\ntrue seizure (however description by provider at the time was \\nvery consistent with seizure). His LP cytology came back \\nnegative for malignant cells. Everolimus can cause seizures \\nhowever his oncologist did not feel this was likely responsible \\ngiven pt had discontinued it prior to hospitalization. \\nEvirolimus will be held in the future regardless. I spoke at \\nlength with his brother and mother about the importance of the \\npatient having someone with him at all times. While he is fully \\nfunctional it is unclear why he seized and it could certainly \\nhappen again. They undertstood the gravity of the situation. For \\nthe short term his mother was going to stay with him until they \\nfigured out a long term solution.\\n\\n#Altered mental status - observed initially during course of \\nhospitalization but resolved. Possibly undetected seizure \\nactivity but unclear. Most likely metabolic/toxic encephalopathy \\nfrom marked metabolic acidosis, dehydration as\\nwell as high dose narcotic use. His narcotic regimen was \\nmarkedly reduced, see below, and he was at his normal baseline \\nfully alert and conversant at the time of discharge.\\n\\n#Hyporenin/Hypoaldosteronism w/ NAGMA and severe hyperkalemia - \\nthis was the main issue initially on arrival.

8106\\t29777917\\t#Pulmonary Embolism: On presentation, the patient was mildly \\ntachycardic to HR 110, BP 135/84, O2 98% on RA. ___, \\ntroponin and pro-BNP were normal. LENIs revealed a RLE DVT and \\nsubsequent CTA demonstrated extensive pulmonary emboli, \\nincluding saddle embolus. TTE was not concerning. The patient \\nwas started on a heparin drip and admitted to Medicine floor \\ngiven that he was hemodynamically stable. He has multiple risk \\nfactors including recent hip surgery in ___, as well as \\nprolonged immobility and frequent travel (particularly prolonged \\nimmobility in car ride). Given that this is the patient\\'s second \\nclot, he likely has an underlying clotting disorder (or \\nunderlying propensity towards clotting), and will most likely \\nneed lifelong anticoagulation. The patient was maintained on a \\nheparin drip for 48 hours with therapeutic PTTs, and he was kept \\non bed-rest for 24 hours given concern for embolism of the \\nremaining RLE DVT to his lungs. The patient then ambulated while \\non the heparin drip without any symptoms; his oxygen saturation \\nwas 96% and he was not tachycardic. He was monitored on \\ntelemetry and did not have any abnormalities. He was \\ntransitioned to apixaban 10mg BID on ___. The treatment plan is \\nas follows: apixaban 10mg BID x 7 days, then apixaban 5mg BID x \\n6 months, then apixaban 2.5 BID indefinitely. The patient was \\ngiven a script for a one month supply of apixaban, and the \\npatient\\'s partner was able to fill the prescription without any \\nissues. We spoke with his general practitioner in ___ to \\nensure good transition of care; he agreed with continuing \\napixaban for lifelong anticoagulation and the need for follow-up \\ncare. The MASCOT team (for management of pulmonary embolisms) \\nsaw the patient on the day of discharge and agreed that the \\npatient appears to be stable and safe for discharge, and agreed \\nwith plans for likely lifelong anticoagulation with apixaban. \\nThe patient was also given instructions to stay well-hydrated, \\nwear the ___ stockings that were provided to him, take his \\napixaban consistently and on time, and make frequent stops to \\nambulate at least every 3 hours. He was instructed NOT to take \\nhis heparin SC injection that he brought with him from ___, \\nand he was instructed NOT to take any blood-thinning medications \\nlike aspirin or NSAIDs. The patient and his partner verbalized \\nunderstanding and agreement with this plan. At the time of \\ndischarge, the patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically \\nstable on apixaban for at least 24 hours.                                                \\t___ is a 56 year old M presenting to the ED with Dyspnea on exertion, R Leg swelling. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Emergency Department and then visited Med/Surg, Discharge Lounge, Discharge Lounge, Medicine, Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).

Post-operatively, he \\nwas transerred to the ICU and intubated for close neurologic \\nmonitoring. A HVAC drain was left in place during the procedure \\nthat was removed on ___ without difficulty. A post-operative \\nhead CT was performed and showed improved midline shift. The \\npatient continued with a poor neurologic exam not fully \\nexplained by the size of his bleed, so he was started on Keppra \\n1000mg BID and put on cvEEG. He had a repeat portable NCHCT on \\n___ that showed expected evolving IPH and stable SAH. Patient \\nhad an MRI on ___ which revealed stable intraparenchymal and \\nSAH with a possible underlying infarct. Neurological exam \\nremained poor in the ICU; therefore repeat NCHCT was obtained on \\n___ which was stable. \\n\\n# Hypertension\\nBlood pressure medications were added and titrated throughout \\nhospitalization to gain adequate blood pressure control. \\n\\n# Fever\\nShortly after surgery the patient spiked a temperature to 101.8. \\nUrine was sent, which was negative. Blood and sputum cultures \\nwere also sent. He was bronched on ___ and BAL was sent. OR \\ncultures from bone flap grew GNR however this was felt to be a \\ncontaminant. The patient continued to be febrile to 102 and was \\nstarted on vanco/cefepime for empiric treatment of presumed VAP. \\n\\n\\n# Respiratory Failure\\nPatient was intubated on admission given poor neurological \\nstatus and emergent OR.

CT Head was negative with nonfocal neurologic exam on the \\nfloor. She was noted to be a very good historian, AAOx3, with \\nsome mild confusion about the former presidents (however, could \\nmake change, name days of week backwards).

She presented with tachycardia otherwise \\nvitals were stable. Leukocyotsis with left shift (WBC of 12.3, \\nPMN 76%) was detected, along with anemia hemoglobin of 8.7 and \\nthrombocytosis PLT of 583. CT A/P demonstrated large  bowel \\nobstruction thus she was admitted to ACS. GI was consulted and \\nscheduled for a colonoscopy. \\nDuring colonoscopy, she was found to have a rectal prolapse. \\nBetween approximately 20-25cm there was severely twisted lumens, \\nwith a distended colon filled with stool and scope  was unable \\nto pass through this point. After procedure, patient\\'s abdomen \\nwas noted to be more distended thus ACS was called for immediate \\nevaluation in the GI suite.  Given ferritin 6 signs, patient was \\ntaken to the OR immediately for exploratory laparotomy.  For \\ndetails of the operation please refer to the operative report.  \\nA colostomy was created. Shortly after in PACU, it was noted to \\nbe retracted into the abdomen, and patient had fecal \\nperitonitis.  Patient was taken back to the OR within 1 hour \\nfrom the original surgery.  A new stoma was re-matured, abdomen \\nremained open with VAC in place, and patient was sent to the ICU \\nfor intensive monitoring.  She was stabilized from her septic \\nshock a few days later her colostomy was noted to be somewhat \\nischemic appearing.  Therefore she was taken back to the OR for \\nreopening of recent laparotomy, excision of splenic flexure and \\nprior colostomy, new transverse colostomy in the left upper \\nquadrant, and closure of midline fascia with wound VAC and \\nsubcutaneous tissue.  The operation was uncomplicated, and \\npatient was sent back to the ICU afterwards.\\n\\nSince the first surgery, patient\\'s stoma has been productive.  \\nShe was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vanco, \\ncefepime, Flagyl, since her admission and continued to do 4 days \\nafter her last operation.  Initially she remained intubated \\nsince the first surgery and after the third and final surgery, \\nsedation was slowly weaned from fentanyl to Precedex and finally \\noff by ___.  She was then extubated on ___, and tube \\nfeeds was started.  On ___, given increasing white blood \\ncount, a CT abdomen pelvis was performed.  Radiology read was \\nconcern for possible ischemic colitis: Lactate 1.6.  C. \\ndifficile was negative.  GI was reconsulted for possible \\ncolonoscopy.  GI recommended against colonoscopy given high risk \\nof perforation, and recommended antibiotic management and \\nmonitoring.  Cipro and Flagyl was started.  Patient remains \\nhemodynamically stable, and white blood count started \\ndowntrending.  Thus, patient was transferred to the floor.                                                \\t___ is a 74 year old F presenting to the ED with n/v/d, Weight loss.

Thought potentially due to \\nnephrolithiasis of a right 4mm stone in the renal pelvis. \\nHowever, US on this admission showed that stone had not moved in \\nposition, making this unlikely to be cause of pain. CTU on \\nprevious admission showed no other etiology of pain. LFTs \\nunchanged from prior, has known NAFLD. Lipase normal and is s/p \\ncholecystectomy. Lupus labs were negative for active flare. \\nPatient was treated initially with oxycodone 5mg q4h but then \\nweaned and transitioned to tramadol 50mg q6h (home dose is 50mg \\nBID). Upon review of ___, patient has received 41 Rxs for \\npain medication from 14 different providers in the last year. In \\naddition, there is a report that patient was discharged from ___ \\n___ clinic because her husband was abusive toward staff \\nregarding narcotics. Given some of these red flags, it was \\ndecided that she would be discharged with a temporary Rx for \\ntramadol 50mg q6h to make it to her PCP apt with the \\nanticipation that either a narcotic contract could be agreed \\nupon with proper monitoring of her narcotic use or that an \\nalternative pain management plan could be decided upon.\\n\\n# Nephrolithiasis. On prior admission, this had been thought to \\nbe contributing to her pain, although it is a 4 mm \\nnonobstructing right upper pole stone and had not yet passed \\ninto the ureter. Urology consulted and given imaging did not \\nfeel 4mm stone was the cause of her pain. Kept on tamsulosin 0.4 \\nmg qhs.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \\n # SLE: continued prednisone 5 mg daily.  \\n # T2DM: covered with ISS.  \\n # Asthma: continued home fluticasone-salmeterol and albuterol\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \\n#Chronic Pain: See above for full details. Patient should either \\nhave narcotics contract at next visit or alternative plan for \\nchronic pain. \\n#Patient required no insulin while admitted with glucose ranging \\nfrom 90-130. Given large amount of insulin with meals (20u with \\nbreakfast and 22u with dinner), concern for causing hypoglycemia \\nat home so patient was instructed to not take insulin, but to \\ncontinue monitoring blood sugar.

However, she had no clear source, given no \\nrespiratory symptoms/findings. She did have a swollen L knee and \\nelbow; however, these joints were neither warm nor erythematous \\nto suggest septic joints. Joint fluid aspiration and analysis \\nwas deferred given thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy as below, \\nand these effusions resolved. Although she developed a painful \\npapular rash along her lower extremities, its appearance and \\nhistopathology were most consistent with erythema nodosum. \\nInfectious disease was consulted given her increased risks \\nsecondary to immunosuppression. She was taken off her \\nimmunosuppressive medications and started on broad spectrum \\nantibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime. She ultimately \\ncompleted a 7 day course of empiric treatment, although her \\ncefepime was discontinued before the final dose given concern \\nfor bone marrow suppression as below. Given recent travel to \\n___, she was placed on PO doxycycline for possible tick-borne \\nillness, which was ultimately coursed for 10 days to cover for \\nrickettsial disease. An extensive infectious workup was done \\nthat resulted in negative macroscopic arthropod nasopharyngeal \\nswab exam, lyme serologies, parasite smear x3, hepatitis \\nserologies, CMV, EBV, parvovirus, C Diff, Anaplasma PCR/IgG/IgM, \\nbabesia PCR/IgG/IgM, leptospirosis antibody. Her blood, urinary, \\nor stool cultures were negative. Her symptoms were likely \\nsecondary to inflammation, which could be attributed to a \\nself-limited viral infection or an underlying autoimmune process \\nas below. On discharge, her fever and tachycardia had resolved. \\nHer pancytopenia remained (see below).\\n\\n#Pancytopenia: During this admission, she had leukopenia (WBCs \\nin the 2s), anemia (Hgb ___, and thrombocytopenia (plts \\n___. She has a history of immunosuppressive treatment with \\netanercept, which could explain her leukopenia. She had also had \\nmild anemia in the past, but never to this degree, and she had \\nnever been thrombocytopenic on previous labs. Although she had \\nseveral bruises distributed along her arms and legs, she had no \\nevidence of active bleeding that could explain an acute drop. \\nThere was concern for worsening infectious or inflammatory \\netiologies that were worked up extensively as above. The recent \\nswitch from voraconazole to posaconazole was suspicious for \\ndrug-induced marrow suppression, and broad spectrum treatment \\nwith cefepime as above could have contributed to persistent \\nsuppression. Hematology was consulted, and after trending her \\ndecreasing blood counts, they decided to do a bone marrow biopsy \\nwhich was inconsistent with drug-induced etiology, but it did \\nshow evidence of low grade lymphoma. Platelet transfusion on \\n___ resulted in appropriate increase, but given that her \\nplatelets rapidly fell again, this was felt to possibly \\nrepresent ITP, prompting IVIG infusion on ___. Unfortunately, \\nthis was unsuccessful in improving her platelet counts. Given \\nthe findings of low grade lymphoma, she was given 4 days of IV \\n40 mg dexamethasone, which did not increase her platelet count. \\nIn order to increase her platelets, she was given a romiplostim \\ninjection on ___, to stimulate platelet production. She was \\ndischarged given that she had no evidence of bleeding and she \\nwould likely need to be followed for quite some time before any \\nof the interventions would have an effect. She was discharged \\nwith clear instructions to watch for bleeding and re-present to \\nthe hospital with warning signs such as bleeding gums, new \\nbruises in unexpected places, or accidental cuts of any kind. \\nShe also had close follow up with hematology the ___ after \\ndischarge.  \\n\\n#Joint pain: Patient presented with diffuse joint pain \\nassociated with myalgias, particularly in her bilateral knees. \\nOn exam, she had effusions in her left knee and elbow. Neither \\nwas warm or erythematous, so low concern for infectious source \\nas above. Rheumatology was consulted, but they declined to do \\nsynovial fluid analysis until improvement in her \\nthrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. The differential included RA \\nflare vs Felty syndrome vs SLE vs drug-induced lupus vs \\nmacrophage activating syndrome. She described her joint pain as \\nworst in the morning with associated stiffness that improved \\nthroughout the day, classic for rheumatoid arthritis. However, \\nshe also reported associated myalgias in her thighs and calves \\nthat has never previously accompanied her RA symptoms. In terms \\nof her laboratory evaluation, she tested positive for rheumatoid \\nfactor, p-ANCA, and ___ (titer 1:40). Despite her \\nseropositivity, these are unlikely the driving factors behind \\nher current presentation given low titers and benign results of \\nother studies. We were less concerned about lupus or \\ndrug-induced lupus given undetectable dsDNA. We were not \\nconcerned for macrophage activation syndrome given persistent \\nnormal range ferritin levels. Rheumatology recommended \\ncontinuing low dose prednisone and careful decision making about \\nfuture biologic therapy because she may be at particularly \\nelevated risks of complications as discussed below. She was \\ndischarged without any DMARD and an appointment with her \\noutpatient rheumatologist. \\n\\n#Hypogammaglobulinemia: Patient also presented with overall \\ndecreased IgG (especially subclasses 2 & 4) and IgA, which could \\nalso be secondary to bone marrow suppression as above. However, \\npatient has a history of recurrent sinopulmonary infections and \\nevidence on BAL of opportunistic infections. The onset of \\nopportunistic infection later in life could be consistent with a \\nlongstanding immunodeficiency but it could also be secondary to \\nimmunosuppressive treatment. She was directed to follow up on a \\nnonurgent basis with allergy and immunology as an outpatient. \\n\\n#Hepatocellular injury: Patient presented with newly elevated \\ntransaminases (max AST/ALT 90/150)and alk phos (max 223) with \\nnormal bilirubin an no evidence of obstruction on RUQUS. This \\nresolved to normal during the hospitalization and was thought to \\nbe posaconazole-induced vs secondary to a viral infection \\ncausing her fevers and joint pain.\\n\\n#Coagulopathy/Lupus anticoagulant: Patient has a h/o elevated \\nPTT thought to be ___ positive lupus anticoagulant, which was \\nconfirmed again with a positive lupus anticoagulant and positive \\nmixing study during this hospitalization. However, further \\nstudies were negative for anticardiolipin antibodies and beta-2 \\nglycoprotein antibodies, making a rheumatologic etiology of this \\ncoagulopathy less likely. As a result, she did not have an \\nindication to be started on anticoagulation, especially as she \\nhas no history of thrombosis. Patient also presented with new \\nelevated ___. Laboratory evaluation was negative for \\nhemolysis, TTP, or DIC, including fibrinogen, fibrin degradation \\nproducts, haptoglobin, or hem/onc blood smears x3. She had a low \\nalbumin 2.7 on ___, which could be reflective of poor \\nnutritional status. She was trialed with PO phytonadione (VitK) \\non ___ with improvement of INR from 1.5 to 1.1. \\n\\n#Aspergillosis:  Previously documented on BAL culture although \\nnever symptomatic. Was previously treated with voriconazole, \\nwhich was switched to posaconazole several weeks prior to \\npresentation. Given the possibility that it was causing \\nsignificant toxicities as above, it was held during her \\nhospitalization. Posaconazole level 853 during this admission, \\nrepeat <5.

He then had an MRI brain, thoracic and \\nlumbar spine which showed metastatic lesions in brain, cervical \\nand thoracic vertebral bodies, sacrum, and soft tissue masses \\ncausing spinal cord narrowing and encasing nerve roots in \\ncervical and thoracic spine. He also had a CT torso which showed \\nmetastatic lesions in lungs, lymph nodes, adrenals, liver, \\nduodenum, and bone. He was started on steroids with improvement \\nin the weakness of his right upper extremity. A biopsy was done \\nby ___ of the mass near the pelvic bone. The biopsy results were \\npending at the time of discharge. Neurosurgery was consulted in \\nthe ED and did not feel a surgical intervention was needed. It \\nwas recommended that the patient stay the night after his biopsy \\nwas done to monitor for pain or complications and to further \\narrange discharge planning however after the patient spoke with \\nhis primary oncologist he insisted on leaving. He was therefore \\ndischarged by the night oncology hospitalist. He was given \\nprescriptions for dexamethasone and oxycodone. When he follows \\nup with his primary oncologist for biopsy results it needs to be \\nconfirmed that he is taking these properly as he was unable to \\nbe appropriately counseled on them given his premature \\ndischarge. The dexamethasone dose can likely be decreased if he \\nis doing well. Radiation oncology was consulted but they were \\nunable to see the patient prior to his unplanned discharged so \\nfollow up with them will need to be arranged as an outpatient. \\nSocial work was consulted and would have followed up the \\nfollowing day but this was not possible due to the discharge. He \\nwould likely benefit from social work follow up to be arranged \\nas an outpatient. Occupational therapy was consulted but also \\nwas not able to see the patient prior to his premature \\ndischarge. Outpatient consultation needs to be arranged as he \\nwas having difficulty with fine motor movements of his right \\nhand including writing and would likely benefit from therapy. \\nHis outpatient oncologist needs to call him with a follow up \\nappointment because this was not arranged and able to be \\nincluded in his discharge paperwork given the unplanned \\ndischarge.\\n \\nHistory of Stroke\\n- The patient\\'s home Aggrenox needs to be stopped acutely in the \\nsetting of possible hemorrhagic brain metastasis seen on the \\nbrain MRI. This was noted on his discharge paperwork but due to \\nleaving the hospital prematurely he was unable to be counseled \\non this so this needs to be followed up as an outpatient.                                                \\t___ is a 63 year old M presenting to the ED with Neck pain.

She was found to have numerous memory deficits \\nand in need of assistant with some ADLs. \\nPsychiatry kindly assessed the patient on ___, obtaining \\ncollateral from family members noting unsafe behavior at home \\nincluding possible delirium. They recommended obtaining OT \\nconsult to assess if patient\\'s home environment is safe. \\n\\nGiven the fact that patient has had recent falls and is not \\nunder supervision at home, there would be a risk of falls, \\nfractures, infections, malnutrition or death if the patient \\nreturns home without increased level of supervision. The patient \\nand family have accepted these risks given the desire to return \\nthe patient home rather than to a long term care facility. \\nPsychiatry followed Ms. ___ closely, ultimately \\ndetermining that she did not have the capacity to make the \\ndecision to return directly to her home from the hospital.

DVT prophylaxis was \\nprovided to the patient, but she often refused these doses. \\nGiven recent falls and the age of the patient, there was no \\nsystemic anti-coagulation initiated, and this can again be \\nconsidered in the outpatient setting.\\n\\n# Urinary Tract Infection:\\nLikely UTI vs early pyelo given urinalysis associated with mild \\nCVA tenderness, treated initially with Levofloxacin 750mg, and \\ntransitioned to Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID for a combined total \\ncourse of 7 days given possible early pyelonephritis. After this \\ncourse of antibiotics, patient noted no further urinary \\nsymptoms. \\n\\n# Hypertension:\\nHypotensive at times, discontinued HCTZ. Lowered Losartan to \\n25mg PO daily.\\n\\n# Hyperlipidemia:\\nStable. On Pravastatin 10 mg PO DAILY. \\n\\n# Vertigo\\nNo complaints of this during hospitalization. Given deliriogenic \\neffects, did not provide the patient her usual: Meclizine 12.5 \\nmg PO DAILY:PRN vertigo. \\n\\n# Insomnia\\nPatient experienced insomnia in hospital and delirium. Did not \\nprovide Ambien as it can be deliriogenic. Restarting this \\nmedication can be considered as an outpatient. Patient was \\ninstead provided Trazodone, and this can be continued as \\noutpatient.                                                \\t___ is a 91 year old F presenting to the ED with s/p Fall.

arthritis, and PMR who was \\ntransferred from ___ for tPA care in the setting \\nof R facial droop, left sided weakness, and aphasia concerning \\nfor stroke. She was last known well on ___ at 0900 and her \\nNIHSS score was 9. She was given tPA at 1155. She had a negative \\nNCHCT and was transferred to ___. On arrival, her NIHSS \\nscore was 7. Her exam here was notable for improvement in mental \\nstatus and speech output as well as improved movement of LUE and \\nLLE and with residual R nasolabial fold flattening. Her CTA \\nshowed a heavily calcified plaque at the L ICA origin causing \\nlumenal narrowing. Given her elevated white count, likely due to \\nrecent pneumonia and/or prednisone taper, she had a CXR and U/A \\nwhich  initially showed no infectious process (see UTI below). \\nShe subsequently had an MR brain which showed no evidence of \\nacute infarct or hemorrhage. Etiology of episode is unknown but \\nthought to likely be anTIA vs. vasovagal syncope. She had a TTE \\nwhich revealed  mild dilation of the left atrium and hypokinesis \\nof the inferior and posterior basal and mid walls without \\nevidence of thrombus. Her EKG and troponin did not reveal \\nconcern for acute ischemia. Although an aberrant heart rhythm \\nwas not observed during this admission, it cannot be ruled out \\nas the primary etiology. Her cardiovascular risk factors include \\nmild hyperglycemia (A1c 6.6%) and significant hyperlipidemia  \\n(LDL 109 and ___ 673). She was started on Atorvastatin 20 mg (not \\na higher dose due to Zocor allergy), and Plavix was reinitiated. \\n\\n    During her admission, she continued to have labile affect, \\nparanoia, and encephalopathy. Due to concerns for a continued \\nreduction in her baseline cognitive function, investigation into \\nreversible causes of delirium were explored. Pramipexole was \\nheld initially (per OMR, held due to nightmares; per family, \\nheld because they wondered if it could cause paranoia); the \\ninitial plan was to restart at half the dose on discharge, but \\nher family declined this. Infection screen revealed a urinary \\ntract infection pan-sensitive enterobacter. She was started on \\nCeftriaxone and transitioned to Bactrim by discharge (to which \\nthe enterobacter was susceptible). Her sleep was very poor while \\ninpatient and disruption of sleep/wake cycle likely contributed \\nto her delirium. Therefore, trazadone was started to help her \\nsleep at night. Her son reported that he observed an episode of \\nbilateral hand/forearm shaking that lasted minutes during this \\nadmission. Therefore, an extended routine EEG was performed and \\nthen expanded to an overnight continuous EEG to better define \\nanomolies observed. Her son reported that he observed an episode \\nof bilateral hand/forearm shaking that lasted minutes during \\nthis admission. Overnight  continuous EEG demonstrated \\ngeneralized slowing and bifrontal and L to R frontal slowing; \\nthe latter could be due to subcortical disease. There was no \\nepileptiform activity.\\n    By discharge, she was following simple commands \\nintermittently, strength in all extremities were at least \\nantigravity, there was paucity of speech but no dysarthria, she \\nwas still not oriented to person/place/time, but her acute \\nconfusional state had improved.  \\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n[ ] F/u with PCP ___ ___ weeks after discharge, appointment \\nstill needs to be scheduled.\\n[ ] F/u with cardiologist, appointment has been scheduled.\\n[ ] F/u with neurologist, appointment has been scheduled.

CT showed \\nmoderate intra-hepatic biliary duct dilation and chronic \\ncholangitis. ___ placed two transhepatic biliary duct drains on \\n___ with initial improvement in her pain.\\n\\nThe pt developed chest pain on ___. EKG did not show \\nischemic changes. Trop was negative. She was seen by cardiology \\nand started on MTP, captopril, and atorvastatin. The pt reported \\nthat the pain was better with burping. A GI etiology was \\nsuspected. MTP was continued. Shortly thereafter, she developed \\na ___ abscess (see below) which explained her \"chest \\npain\" ___ GI pathology. After treatment of the abscess, the pt \\nhad no further chest pain, confirming the non-cardiac etiology.\\n\\nShortly after ___, the pt developed delirium. CT head was \\nnegative for acute changes. She had increasing WBC and fever \\nconsistent with an infectious etiology for her delirium. CT \\nabd/pelvis ___ showed perihepatic ascites with associated\\nperitoneal thickening and enhancement consistent with \\nperitonitis. She was treated with CTX/flagyl. She underwent \\naspiration of the perihepatic collection by ___ and upsizing of \\nher drains on ___. The drains were upsized again ___ and an \\nabscess drain was placed ___ as well. Therefore the pt had two \\ntranshepatic biliary duct drains as well as one ___ \\nabscess drain. ID was consulted ___ who agreed with CTX/flagyl. \\nThe abscess grew klebseilla and mixed bacterial flora.\\n\\nOn ___, the pt\\'s WBC normalized. Her two transhepatic biliary \\ndrains were capped. She had mildly increased RUQ abdominal pain \\non ___ and CT was repeated but it showed improved findings. The \\nabscess was much smaller. There was a residual area of abscess \\non the hepatic dome. The imaging was reviewed by ___ who found \\nthis abscess to be communicating with the drain. Their \\nassessment appears to be correct because the drain continued to \\nhave output, consistent with ongoing drainage of the residual \\nfluid. The pain began to gradually improve without further \\nworsening. Pt remained afebrile and WBC remained normal. AP was \\nvariable but TBili was normal. She was monitored several days \\nwith the biliary drains capped and continued to improve. The pt \\nwas therefore discharged with the following plan:\\n- Biliary drains capped. Follow up with ___ to manage biliary \\ndrains was arranged prior to discharge. ___ care for biliary \\ndrain management was arranged prior to discharge.\\n- Abscess drain remained draining to bulb. Pt and her nursing \\nstudent granddaughter (who lives with her) were trained in how \\nto empty the drain and measure output. They were instructed to \\ncall ___ when the output was <10 cc for three days, so that they \\ncould follow up with ___ at that time to re-assess abx and drain \\nremoval, and for possible re-imaging. This was per ___ \\nrecommendations.\\n- Abx were continued. Pt was given a two week course of \\nprescriptions for cefpodoxime and flagyl. F/up with ID was \\narranged prior to discharge in 1.5 weeks\\' time to determine \\nwhether ongoing abx were required and to possibly re-image.\\n\\nAt the time of discharge, the pt was feeling well. Her pain was \\nmild and controlled with Tylenol and occasional Ultram. She had \\nno chest pain or SOB. She had no confusion. She was ambulating \\nindependently with supervision.

Unable to get MRI due to cochlear \\nimplant, but patient improved clinically throughout the \\nhospitalization. He was screened by physical and occupational \\ntherapy and they thought he would be a good candidate for an \\nacute rehab. \\n\\n#NEURO: He was hospitalized in ___ and discharged with \\nincreased dose of ASA and zetia 10 mg, with instructions to \\nobtain outpatient TTE. However, it appears that patient did not \\ntake full dose aspirin or zetia at home and also did not obtain \\noutpatient TTE. Given that he did not have a fair trial of \\nincreased antiplatelet therapy and cholesterol control, he was \\nstarted on plavix 75 mg (to increase compliance, as patient \\nreported concern with taking aspirin), zetia 10 mg and fish oil \\n(patient reported significant myalgia with all statins he has \\ntried in the past). \\n\\nHis cholesterol was found to be elevated during this \\nhospitalization.

The pt was not \\ntaking morphine in rehab and was discharged a few days prior to \\nadmission. Since discharge, she has endorsed using morphine and \\noxycodone. She has had recent admissions with sedation assoc. \\nwith narcotic use, urinary retention and ___. Her calculated  \\nFeNa/FeUrea both suggested a component of pre-renal/dehydration \\nwhich is supported by patient history (decreased po\\'s for last \\nfew days). CHF was less likely given that most recent echo ___ \\nshowed EF>70%. Obstructive process also possible however renal \\nU/S on ___ showed no nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, or renal \\nmass. Pyelonephritis also possible however pt was afebrile and \\ndid not endorse any CVA tenderness on exam. A foley catheter was \\nplaced and her creatinine rapidly improved. Narcotics were also \\navoided in the management of Mrs. ___ chronic pain. She was \\nclosely monitored for the development of post-obstruction \\ndiuresis. Mrs. ___ remained clinically stable, and on day of \\ndischarge, her Cr. had downtrended to 1.3 from 3.7 on admission. \\n\\n\\n# Type 1 Diabetes\\nPt has T1D complicated by PVD, s/p right BKA. ___ was \\nconsulted to assist in her insulin regimen. She had one episode \\nof hypoglycemia to 28. However her blood sugars stabilized with \\nan adjusted insulin regimen and she remained clinically stable.  \\n\\n\\n# s/p Fall\\nPt suffered mechanical fall ___, falling on left hip, no \\nLOC, no head strike. Imaging of LLE and Head CT were negative \\nfor acute process or fx. Her pain s/p fall was managed with her \\nhome methadone regimen, standing tylenol, and lidocaine patches. \\nGiven her ___, NSAIDs were avoided for pain management, as well \\nas oxycodone and morphine given the potential for urinary \\nretention. Physical Therapy was consulted to evaluate the \\npatient and it was determined that she was safe to return home. \\n\\n# Leukocytosis: \\nPt presents with leukocytosis to 15. Most likely reactive s/p \\nfall onto left hip. No other signs of infection. Pt was afebrile \\nwith all other vital signs wnl. CXR showed no signs of \\nconsolidation, and UA was negative. On day of discharge, her \\nleukocytosis had resolved and she was clinically stable. \\n\\n# Hyponatremia \\nPatient presented with mildly decreased sodium to 128, new since \\nlast admission. Thought to be secondary to volume depletion \\ngiven concurrent hypochloremia, history, and evidence of \\npre-renal azotemia. ___ have been exacerbated by \\npost-obstruction diuresis with inability to retain Na. ___ also \\nhave been mixed picture though as specific gravity not \\nespecially concentrated. The patient received hydration with NS \\nand her hyponatremia resolved. \\n\\n#Acidemia \\nThe patient presented with a mild metabolic acidosis based on \\nlow bicarb and gap (=16). No evidence of infection. Glucose \\nmildly elevated but no ketones in urine. Most likely secondary \\nto azotemia.

TTE from prior admission was negative for \\nvegetations, and TEE this admission was negative for valvular \\nvegetations. No persistent back pain suggestive of epidural \\nabscess or osteomyelitis. Given unclear focus of infection, we \\nordered a torso CT with contrast that showed pulmonary \\ninfiltrates suggestive of \"widespread infection\". However, given \\nno clinical sxs of pneumonia and lack of fevers, further \\nantibiotics were not added on to vancomycin. Tagged WBC scan was \\nnegative for focus of infection. Imaging of the spine with MRI \\nwas not pursued as pt had no neck pain/tenderness and an intact \\nneurological exam; he did have mild numbness/tingling on the \\ndorsal R hand and distal forearm, but he had had this in the \\npast, and the tagged WBC scan was negative and further workup \\nwas deferred.

found down at home after unwitnessed \\nfall, possible syncopal event with NSTEMI, found to have \\ntachyarrhythmia on telemetry.\\n  \\n# NSTEMI: Found to have troponin elevation at OSH without \\nischemic EKG changes. She has minimal risk factors for CAD aside \\nfrom age and she was chest pain free. She has no previous cath \\nresults. Prior to transfer she received a full dose aspirin and \\nwas started on heparin gtt at ___. Repeat troponins here \\nwere found to be downtrending from 0.36 to 0.31. After arrival \\nprimary ACS was thought to be less likely given her history and \\nclinical picture as above. Troponin leak was most likely due to \\ndemand from atrial tachycardia with HR >250. TTE was performed \\non ___ that did not reveal any wall motion abnormalities. \\nGiven that her troponin was downtrending and potential \\nalternative etiology for troponin leak cardiac catheterization \\nwas not performed and heparin gtt was discontinued. Her cardiac \\nmedications regimen was optimized with the addition of ASA 81mg, \\nAtorvastatin 20mg, and metoprolol succinate 25mg daily. She was \\nevaluated at ___ who recommended discharge to rehab. She will \\nfollow-up with Cardiology (Dr. ___.   \\n \\n# Atrial tachyarrhythmia: During her hospitalization, she had \\nseveral episodes of narrow complex tachycardia. While we can\\'t \\nbe sure, a similar rhythm may have precipitated her fall at \\nhome. Initial episode on the day of admission with rates >200 \\nlasting ~20seconds while having a bowel movement. Rhythm \\nself-terminated before 12-lead ECG could be obtained. Based on \\ntelemetry appeared to be most likely atrial in origin. Pt was \\ndiaphoretic but otherwise asymptomatic and remained \\nhemodynamically stable. EP was consulted, who recommended \\nstarting metoprolol, which she tolerated well. They did not want \\nto pursue an EP study at this time. After starting metoprolol \\nonly had one recurrent episode of atrial tachycardia to rate of \\n140\\'s, asymptomatic. She should continue taking metoprolol after \\ndischarge and follow-up with Cardiology as above.  \\n \\n# Status-post fall: Exact circumstances surrounding her \\nunwitnessed fall remain unclear, but it is plausible that she \\nmay have syncopized from an arrhythmia as above. It is also \\npossible the fall was a result of her deconditioning leading to \\ngeneralized weakness and fall. Imaging revealed no evidence of \\nneck, hip, right knee or ankle fracture. She was given tylenol \\nand tramadol for pain. ___ recommended rehab for discharge. \\n\\n# Chronic osteoarthritis of right knee with effusion: According \\nto family pt has chronic osteoarthritis of bilateral knees that \\nhas been treated with steroid injections in the outpatient \\nsetting. During admission she was noted to have deformity of \\nright knee on exam that appeared chronic in nature with evidence \\nof degenerative changes, chrondocalcinosis and effusion on XRAY \\nsuggestive of chronic osteoarthritis v. pseudogout. There was no \\nerythema or pain on exam consistent with septic joint. The \\ndecision was made not to aspirate joint fluid while inpatient. \\nShe was evaluated by ___ with mobility somewhat limited due to \\nknee pain. Home Celebrex was discontinued due to cardiovascular \\nrisk. She was started on ibuprofen as needed. She will have \\nfollow-up with Rheumatology after discharge. \\n \\n# Mitral regurgitation: TTE performed on ___ revealed moderate \\nto severe 3+ MR. ___ remained asymptomatic without evidence of \\npulmonary edema or volume overload to suggest heart failure on \\nexam.   \\n \\n# Dementia: Continued home Donepezil 10 mg PO QD.\\n  \\n# Depression: Continued home Sertraline.  \\n\\n# Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated at 8.2. Home levothyroxine was \\ncontinued at 100mcg daily.

This rash \\nappeared in the context of a new medication (oxycodone), after \\ncompletion of a course of ciprofloxacin.\\n\\nACTIVE ISSUES\\n# DRUG RASH: Rash appeared after a few days of taking both cipro \\nand oxycodone. The rash was Maculopapular rash on her lower \\nlegs, forearms, upper chest. Dermatology saw her and thought \\nthis was likely was sun eruption/sensitivity caused by the \\ncipro. They recommended topical steroid. Give the way the rash \\nappeared they felt this was not vascultis and did not biopsy. \\nHer rash improved slowly and on the day of discharge was faint. \\nThere was no skin breakdown. \\n\\n# GERD vs. GASTRITIS:  Abdominal pain was chiefly \\nPeriumbilical/central, and had been ongoing for some time.  Had \\nrecently downtitrated herself on her PPI from 40mg daily to 20mg \\ndaily, to worsening of the pain.  Pt was increased on her PPI \\ndose to 40mg BID, and given a GI cocktail \\n(Maalox/lidocaine/Benadryl) to help with her abdominal pain.  \\nThe pain was much improved upon discharge. Prednisone was \\nincreased from 10 to 40 mg daily, empirically, given concern for \\neosinophilic esophagitis/gastritis, given elevated AEC. Patient \\nto have EGD on ___ at ___.\\n\\n*** NOTE: plan was for discharge on 40 mg daily, though error in \\ndischarging; patient sent home with 10 mg daily instead. Reached \\nout to PCP to discuss dose change. Pulm will follow and control \\nsteroid dose as out patient*** \\n\\n# DYSPHAGIA:  Occasional dysphagia to pills, not bothersome per \\nPt.  Pt was to follow up with her GI (Dr. ___ at their \\nregularly scheduled appointment on ___ for further workup of \\nthis issue. Motility study scheduled in ___ (though unclear \\nwhy long interval). \\n\\n# LEUKOCYTOSIS WITH EOSINOPHILIC PREDOMINANCE:  Pt without \\ninfectious symptoms of fevers, chills, cough, N/V/D, dysuria, or \\nhematuria.  Most likely cause of leukocytosis was related to \\npresumed EGPA. Leukocytosis likely with contribution from \\nchronic prednisone. Eosinophilic predominance was likely due to \\nthe setting of EGPA, though an ongoing allergic drug reaction \\ncould have contributed to her eosinophilia as well. Pt was \\ncontinued on Benadryl and treated for EGPA with her home \\nsteroids (prednisone 10mg daily) initially, though with \\nrefractory abdominal pain, prednisone was increased to 40 mg \\ndaily. After this, AEC fell to normal. She was discharged with \\nfollow up with pulmonology scheduled for ___, where they would \\nbegin a slow taper and further management of the prednisone.                                                \\t___ is a 73 year old F presenting to the ED with Abd pain, Rash.

Very frequent episodes of the \\nsame were captured on EEG without electrographic correlate, \\nthough an electroclinical seizure captured during the admission \\nwas noted to have similar semiological onset as these episodes, \\nraising the possibility of focal seizures not fully \\ncharacterized on EEG. Due to concern for VNS dysfunction as the \\netiology of the electrical sensations, the VNS was turned off \\nfor one day, without changes in symptoms. The frequency of these \\nepisodes decreased over the course of the admission and resolved \\nby time of discharge. \\n\\nIn addition to the above seizure, three additional focal-onset \\nelectro-clinical seizures were noted during the admission with \\nright head turn, right gaze deviation, and right arm extension, \\ntwo of which included left arm extension and delayed left head \\nturn.\\n\\nOver the course of the hospitalization, clobazam was \\ndiscontinued due to concerns for increased adverse events and \\nlimited efficacy per Ms. ___ mother\\'s report, though \\nweaning of clobazam was not clearly associated with a decrease \\nin the aforementioned episodes of sensory disturbance, head \\nbobbing, or grunting. In light of the concern for initial \\nbreakthrough seizures at home and continued seizures during the \\nhospitalization, valproic acid and cannabidiol doses were \\nuptitrated and clonazepam was added to replace clobazam which \\ncaused behavioral side effects according to her mom.\\n\\nPatient was also noted have low blood pressures during this \\nadmission as well as in prior admissions. Endocrine screening \\nwas notable for indeterminate thyroid and cortisol levels (with \\nconcerns for medication interference or acute illness effects in \\nconsultation with Endocrinology), prompting a cortisol \\nstimulation test with robust but sub-normal response, again \\ninterpreted as indeterminate. Outpatient follow-up was \\nrecommended with Endocrinology with recommendation for prompt \\nevaluation of symptoms of hypotension (such as dizziness or \\nlightheadedness) for potential adrenal insufficiency.\\n\\nPatient being discharged directly to long term care facility.  \\nIn person transitional meeting with neurology team, neurology \\nstaff nursing, patients mother, and facility was held on day of \\ndischarge.                                                \\t___ is a [UNKNOWN AGE] year old [UNKNOWN SEX] presenting to the ED with s/p Fall, Seizure.

fall: Code stroke was called in the \\nED, and pt was evaluated by Neurology. CT/CTP head and CTA head \\nand neck unremarkable. Per neurology, spinal process with \\nfunctional overlay was less likely as she improved quickly and \\nher symptoms resolved without intervention. Tox screen was \\nnegative. Her symptoms were more likely functional secondary to \\nfear of chronic pain (pt\\'s mother had history of chronic pain \\nfollowing similar fall). She denied any history of psychiatric \\ndisorder. She denied feeling depressed and declined speaking to \\nsocial work. Pt stated she felt safe at home and was ready for \\ndischarge. \\n\\n# neck pain: Pt complained of neck pain secondary to fall. No \\nfractures per imaging. Cervical tenderness improved and her \\nc-spine was cleared. She was given tylenol as needed for pain.\\n\\n# ___: Pt with Cr 1.6 on admission, likely prerenal ___ in \\nsetting of no po intake during fall.  She received 1L NS and Cr \\ntrended to 0.3                                                \\t___ is a [UNKNOWN AGE] year old [UNKNOWN SEX] presenting to the ED with AMS.

There was evidence of large stool burden and \\ninflammation near ostomy site on CT abd/pelvis. The patient then \\ndeveloped explosive diarrhea night of ___ and tested positive \\nfor C. difficile infection. Patient was initially treated with \\np.o. vancomycin 125 mg with a planned 10 day regimen. However, \\nshe subsequently developed nausea, vomiting, and worsening \\nabdominal pain and was diagnosed with an ileus based on serial \\nabdominal imaging. Her antibiotics were changed to high-dose \\np.o. vancomycin and IV metronidazole. GI was consulted made \\nrecommendations for further management of ileus. Patient\\'s tube \\nfeeds were transiently held and she was kept n.p.o. to \\nfacilitate bowel rest. Her tube feeds were then advanced as \\ntolerated along with her diet. Patient was encouraged to chew \\ngum and was asked to ambulate multiple times a day. With such \\nsupportive measures as well as antibiotics, the patient began to \\nimprove. Her nausea and vomiting ceased and her abdominal pain \\nbecame much closer to her baseline chronic abdominal pain. \\nPatient\\'s PEG tube site was noted to be mildly erythematous and \\nthis area was evaluated by nursing and GI who recommended \\nmupirocin ointment to prevent infection.\\n\\n# Provoked seizure\\nPatient presented to the hospital with a history of possible \\nwitnessed seizure at home. Neurology was consulted and felt that \\nthis was most likely in the setting of benzodiazepine withdrawal \\nas the patient had run out of her clonazepam and had not taken \\nit for 2 days prior to presentation. A noncontrast head CT was \\nreassuring as there is no obvious mass or organic cause of her \\nseizure. Patient was also placed on a video EEG that did not \\ndemonstrate seizure activity. MRI head showed nonspecific \\nfindings that should be followed up within 3\\x966 months with \\nrepeat MRI. Patient was continued on her 3 times daily \\nclonazepam regimen and did not have any other recurrence of \\nseizure or altered mental status during her hospital stay. \\nPatient was counseled on the fact that she could not drive for 6 \\nmonths because of her seizure per ___ law. \\nPatient we need to follow-up in outpatient neurology clinic \\nafter discharge.\\n\\n# ___\\nPatient initially complained of chest pain on presentation. \\nUnclear etiology of chest pain. The chest pain was thought to be \\npossibly related to the patient\\'s scleroderma, as she had known \\nesophagitis and esophageal stricture, as well as interstitial \\nlung disease. The patient also had HFpEF (EF 55%, non-ischemic \\nstress cardiomyopathy), so cardiac etiology was possible but her \\nischemic workup was negative and her troponins were negative ×3. \\nHer home lisinopril and metropolol were held given diarrhea and \\nrelative hypotension during her hospital stay.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n==============\\n# Polysubstance use disorder\\n# Anxiety\\nPatient was continued on home doses of fluoxetine, mirtazapine, \\nclonazepam, methadone.\\n\\n# Scleroderma (diffuse systemic cutaneous)\\nNoted.

There was no evidence of diffuse \\naxonal injury or intracranial hemorrhage.  There also was no \\nevidence of a cortical dysplasia or mesial temporal sclerosis. \\nBedside EEG monitoring\\nHe was then started on continuous EEG monitoring on ___ to \\nevaluate for any possible epileptiform or seizure activity, and \\ncontinued to be monitored for 48 hours.

His chest x ray did show bilateral \\nsmall pleural effusions noted from prior imaging. His exam \\noverall was not consistent with a grossly hypervolemic picture \\nand his weight and BNP were baseline for him. We treated with \\nsteroids methylpred 125mg X2 doses and then wanted to PO \\nprednisone 40mg which he will likelu need for a prolonged taper \\nperiod about another week post discharge for a total of 10 days. \\nHe also received IV Lasix 40 mg on the night of admission and IV \\nLasix 60 mg in the ED. On the floor we further diruesed with \\n120mg IV Lasix to which he responded minimally. Despite the poor \\ndiuresis output his 02 requirement improved with the steroids \\nmaking COPD exacerbation even more likely. We also started \\nazithromycin for a total of a 5 day course started on ___ \\nlast day set for ___. We also treated with duonebs and avair \\nfor bronchodilator support. We felt there was no need for long \\nterm Bactrim on discharge since he should complete this taper \\nshortly and is on 4mg mehtylpred daily (<20mg pred equivalent \\ndaily) but this should be considered in the future if he \\nrequires further high dose bursts. \\n\\n#HFrEF \\n#AORTIC STENOSIS\\nPatient has history of HFrEF depressed EF to 15%. On his last \\nadmission he was found to have this as an acute drop from prior \\nfunction of 30% on previous imaging with known severe aortic \\nstenosis. On the last admission these results were reviewed with \\nTAVR team (Dr ___ who did not feel patient\\nwould be a candidate for TAVR though could consider balloon \\naortic valvuloplasty if a viable candidate. On this admission we \\ndiuresed as above with 120mg IV Lasix without good response \\nsince he was likely more dry in the setting of a COPD \\nexacerbation. We also repeated a TTE to evaluate for possible \\nworsening of his EF which was stable at ___. This TTE showed \\nan aortic valve peak velocity 2.4ms of mean gradient of 15mmHg; \\nArea calculated as 2.5cm. We ultimately resumed his home \\ntorsemide dosing, metoprolol. Of note not on ACEi since has soft \\nBPs in the past. \\n\\n#NSTEMI: Patient presented without chest pain but with elevated\\ntroponin. This is likely Type II NSTEMI in the setting of CKD \\nand\\nCOPD exacerbation/?CHF exacerbation. Cardiac cath in ___ showed\\nno sign of significant obstructive CAD. EKG in the ED showed ST\\ndepressions in leads V4-V6 (V4 new) and T wave inversions in\\ninferior leads. Trop trended and peaked at .___t .07 on ___. We continued his home atorvastatin, \\naspirin and metoprolol.\\n\\n#Constipation: Patient had not had a BM in 5 days. WE gave an \\naggressive bowel regimen and he had a bowel movement.\\n\\n#PAML: Confirmed with daughter \\n\\n========================\\nChronic Medical Issues;\\n========================\\n\\n#CKD: Patient presents with Cr of 1.4, his baseline. This did \\nincrease slightly to 1.7 after diuresis. He was likely pre-renal \\nand we held further IV diuresis. On the day of discharge his Cr. \\nhad improved to 1.5 and he was continued on his home torsemide \\n60mg BID. \\n\\n#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: We continue his home Metoprolol. He was \\ndosed once with 3.5mg per his home dosing regiment and his INR \\nincreased to 2.9 from 2.5 with this dose. He will be discharged \\non his continued home warfarin dosing regimen with plan for \\nfollow up with PCP. Goal ___.

Febrile upon \\nadmission. CXR identifying pulmonary consolidation with likely \\npneumonia. He required ICU admission and O2 via nasal cannula, \\nbut was never intubated. No typical organism identified on \\nsputum culture. Patient initially received cefepime ___ the ED, \\nand was switched to levofloxacin ___ the ICU (day ___.

Cardiac biomarkers with troponin-T peak \\nat 0.03 with MB at 18. Cardiology was consulted who did not feel \\nstrongly this was NSTEMI, but given improved respiratory status \\nand poor vascular substrate, patient was transferred to ___ \\ncardiology service for further consideration. Troponin quickly \\nnormalized. On ___, CK added on to prior specimens, and we \\ndiscovered that peak MB of 18 was associated with CK 1620 with \\nMB index 1.1%, arguing against cardiac origin of the CK-MB. His \\nstatin was discontinued. The elevated CK and CK-MB were felt \\nmost likely related to viral prodrome and myositis or statin \\ninduced myopathy rather than true cardiac injury. Troponin-T \\ncould also be explained by sepsis and direct renal injury (no \\nhypotensive events). D-Dimer negative. Statin was resumed on day \\nof discharge when CK normalized. The patient ambulated briskly \\n___ the hallways without anginal symptoms. Since he was \\nrecovering from his pneumonia, he was felt not to be an optimal \\ncandidate for PCI at this time. Further assessment of residual \\nischemia by stress testing was deferred to his outpatient \\ncardiologist after full recovery from his pneumonia.\\n\\n# CAD: As above, echocardiogram showed significant ventricular \\nakinesis though this is likely chronic/silent previous event or \\nsubacute, as the wall motion abnormality is out of proportion to \\nthe CK-MB of 18. No ischemic events were noted during this \\nadmission. He was continued on his home ASA, clopidogrel, \\nbeta-blocker and ___. His statin was held as above until his CK \\nnormalized.\\n\\n# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure with Reduced EF(35%): Patient \\nhas never used diuretics and did not know a dry weight. Weight \\non admission was 117.8 kg and relatively stable throughout \\nhospital course, with discharge weight 116.3 kg. Last prior LVEF \\n25% ___ ___, 35% on echocardiogram this admission. On admission, \\nhe was noted to have mild pulmonary edema on CXR with rales on \\nauscultation and elevated NT-Pro-BNP consistent with a diastolic \\nheart failure exacerbation. Patient\\'s hypoxia liked caused by \\nhis pneumonia, but the relative contribution of his heart \\nfailure was difficult to determine.

Transferred to the ICU where he \\nwas fluid resuscitated and stabilized on insulin gtt. Then moved \\nto the floor for ongoing titration of SQ insulin.\\n\\n#Hyperglycemia: Initially presented in DKA to OSH, transferred \\nto ___ and stabilized in the MICU. It was thought likely \\nsecondary to IPMN, though this may very well be an unrelated \\nprocess. He had an A1c of 10.3 (up from 5.5 in ___ which \\nsuggests some chronicity, though this is an unusual first \\npresentation of T2DM given acuity and age.

Encephalopathy: The pt was taken for EGD on ___, requiring \\ngeneral anesthesia and intubation.  Following extubation, the pt \\nwas somnolent.  Initially, this was felt to be related to \\nanesthetic effect.  However, the pt\\'s mental status did not \\nimprove.  On ___, she was too somnolent to be consented for \\nher colonoscopy.  The pt continued to be A&O x 2, inattentive, \\neasily agitated, and perseverative throughout the morning of \\n___.  At around 12:30 ___ on ___, the pt triggered for \\naltered mental status.  She was not tachycardic, hypotensive, \\nfebrile, or hypoxic.  Her work up was notable for ___, but \\notherwise was unrevealing.  All of her sedating medications \\n(oxycodone, zolpidem, gabapentin) were stopped.  The pt \\ncontinued to be somnolent and at around 5 ___ on ___ a VBG \\nshowed CO2 retention.  The medical ICU was consulted given \\nconcern for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Nalaxone was \\nadministered and produced a short-lived response, but repeat VBG \\ncontinued to show CO2 retention and the pt was transferred to \\nthe medical ICU for naloxone drip and possible BiPAP on ___ \\nin the setting of hyerpcarbic respiratory failure. She improved \\nand was transferred back to the floor. \\n\\n# Gastrointestinal Bleed in the Setting of Hereditary \\nHemorrhagic Telangiectasias (HHT): The pt presented to the ED \\nwith bloody BMs.  She has a history of multiple prior GIBs from \\nHHT requiring blood tranasfusions.  Her hgb was 4.4 on admission \\nand she ultimately received 3 U pRBC on ___.  Her hgb \\nstabilized by ___.  She had EGD on ___ showing multiple \\nAVMs without a clear culprit lesion.  She had 8 AVMs treated.  \\nShe was scheduled to undergo colonoscopy on ___, but this \\nwas aborted due to encephalopathy.  She remained on a BID PPI.  \\nThe gastroenterology service was following throughout the \\nmedical floor course.\\n\\n# Acute Kidney Injury: The pt\\'s creatinine was 0.9 on admission \\nand increased to 1.7 by ___.  This was likely related to \\nvolume overload. The pt\\'s ___ likely decreased renal clearance \\nof sedating medications and may have contributed to the pt\\'s \\ndevelopment of encephalopathy. \\n\\n# Diastolic CHF from pulmonary HTN with right to left shunting \\nvia PFO vs proximal intrapulmonary shunting from HHT with \\nchronic hypoxemia:  Dry weight is approximately 185 pounds.  Pt \\ndid not feel volume overloaded and had no ___ edema, JVD, or \\ncrackles on admission.  Her furosemide was held in the setting \\nof GI bleed, in holding became volume overloaded requiring \\ndiuresis with IV Lasix. She improved and was transitioned to \\nhome PO Lasix. \\n\\n# DM II: Followed by ___.  On Glargine 18 U QAM and 22 U QHS \\nwith Humalog SS at home. Decreased insulin dose while on clear \\nliquid diet and NPO. \\n\\n# HTN: Held lisinopril in setting of GIB, resumed on discharge.  \\n\\n \\n# OSA: Continued CPAP\\n\\n# Asthma: Continued supplemental O2 and albuterol\\n\\n# Gout: Continued home colchicine\\n\\n# Chronic pain: Continued gabapentin, oxycodone on admission.  \\nThese medications were stopped on ___ in the setting of \\naltered mental status. Ultimately restarted home oxycodone as \\nher mental status improved since it seemed she was having opioid \\nwithdrawal, but her oxycontin was held, Neurontin dose was \\ndecreased. \\n\\n#Insomnia: On discharge encouraged pt to stop zolpidem, although \\npt resistant. Discharged with instruction to take half her usual \\ndose (5mg) given concern for use of higher dose in women.  \\n\\n# HLD: Continued simvastatin\\n\\nMICU COURSE: ___\\nOn evening of ___, patient was noted to be less responsive. Out \\nof concern for decreased responsiveness this evening, a venous \\nblood gas was obtained which was 7.18/___, with physical \\nexamination notable for pinpoint pupils and bilateral pulmonary \\ncrackles. The patient was administered Narcan with improvement \\nin mental status, and gradual improvement in her blood gas to \\n7.19/69, and 1 hour later 7.24/___ after administration of second \\ndose of Narcan. The decision was made to transfer the patient to \\nthe MICU for closer observation and management of hypercarbic \\nrespiratory failure resulting in respiratory acidosis. \\n\\n#Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to opiate \\nadministration in the setting of ___, as the patient improved \\nafter administration of narcan x2 on the floor. Also likely \\ncomponent of volume overload, as patient with trace edema and \\nbilateral crackles on physical examination. Patient  started on \\nnarcan gtt in the MICU with return to baseline mental status. \\nShe also received IV diuresis with lasix with improvement in her \\nrespiratory status \\n\\n#Fever: Patient febrile to 101.4 prior to transfer to MICU, no \\nlocalizing symptoms at that time. Given normal WBC and absence \\nof clear infectious source, antibiotics was held. Infectious \\nworkup was repeated upon arrival.\\n\\n# Acute blood loss anemia: Pt has history of multiple GI bleeds \\nin the past from HHT and has required transfusions in the past \\nand during this admission. On transfer to MICU, Hgb noted to be \\n6.9 and she received 1U PRBC. No frank bleeding during MICU \\nstay. \\n\\nMEDICAL FLOOR COURSE 2\\n# Encephalopathy: On return to the floor, the pt\\'s was improved, \\nbut she remained encephalopathic.  She was inattentive and \\nresponded to questions inappropriate.  She also remained \\ndisoriented.  On ___, her mental status was greatly \\nimproved.  She was discharged on Percocet 5 mg Q6H PRN pain, \\ngabapentin 100 mg TID (down from 800 mg TID), and zolpidem \\ndecreased from 10mg to 5mg to minimize sedating medications. \\n\\n# Acute Blood Loss Anemia from GI Bleed in the setting of HHT: \\nLast transfusion was ___.  Her hgb remained stable during \\nher second medical floor course. Deferred further intervention \\ngiven concern for encephalopathy. \\n\\n# ___: Her ___ was likely related to volume overload, resolved \\nwith diuresis.  Anemia may also have contributed.  Her \\ncreatinine returned to baseline and was 0.9 on discharge.\\n \\n# Diastolic CHF from pulmonary HTN with right to left shunting \\nvia PFO vs proximal intrapulmonary shunting from HHT with \\nchronic hypoxemia:  On return to the floor, was found to be \\nvolume overloaded in setting of holding home furosemide. She \\nreceived 40 mg IV furosemide on ___ and was restrated on her \\nhome 40 mg PO furosemide per day on ___.  She is on \\nsupplemental O2 at home at baseline.\\n\\n# DM II: Followed by ___.  On Glargine 18 U QAM and 22 U QHS \\nwith Humalog SS at home. Halved insulin dose while on clear \\nliquid diet and NPO. Blood sugars continued to be well \\ncontrolled on this decreased regimen in hospital after diet was \\nadvanced, so was continued on discharge. \\n\\n# HTN: Held lisinopril in setting of GIB, resumed on discharge.  \\n\\n \\n# OSA: Continued CPAP\\n\\n# Asthma: Continued supplemental O2 and albuterol\\n\\n# Gout: Restarted home colchicine when ___ resolved\\n\\n# Chronic pain: Decreased doses of gabapentin and oxycodone as \\nabove\\n\\n# HLD: Continued simvastatin                                                \\t___ is a [UNKNOWN AGE] year old [UNKNOWN SEX] presenting to the ED with Rectal pain.

CXR and UA \\nunremarkable and absent of symptoms. No clear skin breakdown. No \\nabdominal pain and negative CT abd/pelvis makes GI source \\nunlikely. LP negative for meningitis. MRI at ___ ___ \\nL3-S1 narrowing and inflammation in the sacrum, unable to rule \\nout infection. Biopsy was decided to be too high risk by ___ \\nID and ___.

Other inflamed joints during his \\nadmission were his L knee and L PIP joints which have now \\nresolved.\\n  \\n# Leukopenia: DDx significant for colchine vs. ceftriaxone.  \\nCeftriaxone was the more likely culprit as colchicine was \\nstarted only shortly before the onset of leukopenia.  ___ \\nnormalized prior to discharge. \\n\\n#Acute Encephalopathy: Now resolved. Initially with symptoms of \\ndelirium and unable to give a history.  Likely secondary to \\ninfectious process and he improved to being AAOx3 and conversant \\nafter continuing the antibiotics. \\n  \\n# Hyperbilirubinemia: Elevated on admission to 1.7, but quickly \\nresolved after antibiotics. Possibly cholestasis of sepsis.  No \\nsignificant RUQ pain during admission.\\n\\n# HTN: Anti-hypertensives were initially held due to concern for \\nbacteremia and for initial hypotension.

We continued her home ASA but held her \\nantihypertensives for 2 doses until we had the MRI confirming no \\nnew stroke.  She received an EEG prior to discharge; the \\npreliminary read is overall normal but the final read from the \\nEpileptologist was pending at the time of discharge.  Given her \\nsymptoms but negative imaging findings, we discussed with the \\npatient upon discharge that we felt stroke/TIA was unlikely (at \\nleast in this most recent episode), and the more likely \\npossibilities at this point in time were either complex partial \\nseizure or complex migraine variant.  We discharged her home on \\nall of her home medications with the addition of Verapamil to \\ntreat complex migraine variant.  She will follow up with Dr. \\n___ in Stroke ___ in one month.\\n\\n# Cardiovascular:\\nHer blood pressure was stable throughout her admission. Troponin \\nwas 0.13 (1600 ___ on admission, then trended to 0.14 (2400 \\n___, and finally 0.1 (0800 ___.  She denied chest pain or \\nother symptoms of myocardial ischemia throughout her admission, \\nand her EKG in the ED was unremarkable.  Regardless, cardiology \\nwas consulted to help us determine if she could be having silent \\nmyocardial ischemia.  They felt that this was unlikely and did \\nnot recommend any changes to our plan.  We started her \\nantihypertensive medications prior to discharge once her MRI \\nshowed no new stroke.\\n\\n# Pulmonary:\\nCXR was non-focal, and she remained stable from a respiratory \\nstandpoint throughout her admission\\n\\n# Renal:\\nElectrolytes were stable, as were BUN and Cr, throughout her \\nadmission.\\n\\n# Infectious disease:\\nThere were no fevers or other signs or symptoms of infecion \\nduring this admission.\\n\\n# FEN/GI:\\nShe ate well during this admission.

Patient should \\nfollow up with PCP regarding restarting these medications or \\ndose adjustments.\\n \\n#  DM2: Patient on Glargine 10 U qHS and Metformin 1000 mg QD on \\nadmission.  Lactate elevated to 2.2 on admission.  Lactate \\ndecreased to 1.7 with holding metformin and giving IV fluids.  \\nPatient\\'s blood sugar was low-normal on admission.  During \\nhospitalization, patient\\'s metformin and glargine were held, was \\nstarted on HISS, and patient was on diabetic diet.  Despite \\nholding metformin/glargine, patient\\'s blood sugars remained < \\n180 throughout.  Patient did not require any insulin from the \\nsliding scale.  Patient\\'s AMS may have been due to low blood \\nsugars on her home diabetes regimen.  Patient was discharged on \\n500 mg metformin (decrease from admission dose of 1000) and off \\nglargine.

Cardiac work-up was negative (unchanged EKG, negative \\ntroponins x3 and CK-MD, and negative stress ECHO). LENIs were \\nnegative for DVT in RLE where she reported swelling + \\ntenderness. Etiology remained unclear but leading differential \\nwould be an allergic reaction vs panic attack given clinical \\npicture. \\n\\n===========\\nACUTE ISSUES\\n===========\\n# Chest pain\\nPatient presented with ~10 minutes of chest pain, generalized \\npruritis, and n/v. Differentials initially considered were: ACS \\nvs PE vs panic attack vs allergic reaction given generalized \\npruritis. Patient has no h/o cardiac dz though possesses \\nmultiple risk factors for ACS (obesity, DM, smoker) so cardiac \\nwork-up was initiated. EKG showed no change from prior in ___, \\ntroponins were negative x3, and stress ECHO was benign. Given \\n~1wk of immobility d/t recent illness, patient was also at risk \\nfor PE. LENIs were obtained and showed no clot in the RLE. Given \\nconcurrent lack of respiratory distress, absence of hypoxia, and \\nbaseline HR, suspicion for PE was low. Generalized pruritis \\nseemed to indicate allergic reaction, however no satisfactory \\ntrigger could be discovered in her history. \\n\\n# Hyperlipidemia\\nHyperlipidemia discovered on cardiac work-up. ___ ASCVD risk \\nis 5.3% and lifetime ASCVD risk is >39%. Moderate-intensity \\nstatins would likely be of benefit in this patient. She had \\npreviously discussed starting statin with PCP but never started. \\nWith patient\\'s concurrence, atorvastatin 10mg QD and ASA81mg \\nwere started for primary prevention of CVD. \\n\\n# Epigastric pain\\n# Malaise\\n# Diarrhea\\n# Mild colitis/viral gastroenteritis\\nPrior to her chest pain, patient endorsed ~2 wks of general \\nmalaise with abdominal pain and occasional diarrhea. She has 3 \\nchildren who are often sick. In the absence of fevers and \\nleukocytosis, her clinical picture suggested a viral \\ngastroenteritis. CT showed mild colitis of the descending colon \\nand sigmoid which would also be consistent with an infectious \\netiology. There was low concern for biliary or pancreatic \\npathologies. RUQUS showed cholelithiasis but no cholecystitis. \\nLipase was wnl. Antibiotics were not started given suspected \\nviral etiology. Patient improved with supportive care. \\n\\n# BRBPR\\nWhile in ED, she began to have bloody stools (with \"red specks\") \\nlikely d/t colitis, though hemorrhoids can\\'t be ruled out. Hgb \\ndropped from 14.8 to 10.8 and was stable at time of discharge. \\nShe was hemodynamically stable throughout her course with low \\nconcern of acute large-volume GI bleed. \\n\\n===============\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n===============\\n# Depression: Continue bupropion\\n\\n# DM: Hold hold metformin/glyburide, ISS\\n\\n# GERD: Continue home omeprazole \\n\\n===============\\nRESOLVED ISSUES\\n===============\\n# AGMA\\n# Elevated lactate\\nPatient presented with anion-gap metabolic acidosis and elevated \\nlactate likely d/t dehydration iso viral gastroenteritis. She \\nquickly improved with IVF. Labs showed no DKA and there was low \\nsuspicion of metformin-induced lactate acidosis given no recent \\nmedication changes.\\n\\n===================\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n- Follow up with PCP to decide whether to continue with \\natorvastatin 10mg QD and ASA 81mg for primary convention. \\n- No further cardiac work-up indicated at this time. \\n\\n[ x] The patient is safe to discharge today, and I spent [ ]\\n<30min; [x ] >30min in discharge day management services.                                                \\t___ is a [UNKNOWN AGE] year old [UNKNOWN SEX] presenting to the ED with Chest pain.

Over the course of her hospital course, ___ started at Med/Surg/GYN and then visited Emergency Department, Med/Surg/GYN, Emergency Department Observation. Over the course of their hospital stay, her was given the following diagnoses: Cholangitis, Obstruction of bile duct, Hypotension, unspecified, Chronic airway obstruction, not elsewhere classified, Unspecified schizophrenia, unspecified, Esophageal reflux, Constipation, unspecified, Macular degeneration (senile), unspecified, Personal history of malignant neoplasm of large intestine, Personal history of malignant neoplasm of liver, Other acquired absence of organ, Family history of malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract, Personal history of other malignant neoplasm of skin in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures: Endoscopic insertion of stent (tube) into bile duct in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications:\\n32193\\t32209\\t27585204\\tThe patient is a ___ year old female with h/o metastatic renal \\ncell cancer with mets to bone, lungs, liver and adrenals, also \\ncomplicated by hypercalcemia, h/o GIB, h/o afib on coumadin, h/o \\nsystolic heart failure and recent diastolic heart failure \\nexacerbation presents with acute diastolic heart failure in the \\nsetting of starting axitinib as a new chemotherapy agent, and \\ndeveloping elevated blood pressures and fluid retention \\nconsistent with an acute systolic/diastolic heart failure \\nexacerbation. Per discussion with her oncologist, this pattern \\nhas occurred for the patient with prior agents in this class, \\nand has required adjustment of her cardiac regimen to enable the \\npatient to tolerate her chemotherapy.\\n\\nHer hospital course has been notable for effective diuresis with \\nIV furosemide for the acute heart failure exacerbation, a \\ncatheter-associated UTI, and electrolyte abnormalities including \\nhypophosphatemia, which led to nausea and vomiting associated \\nwith the oral formulation. Of note, the patient\\'s baseline \\nfunctional status due to bilateral pathological hip fractures \\nnecessited a foley catheter during IV diuresis for wound \\nreasons..\\n\\nPrimary: 42___.31 HEART FAILURE, (B1) ACUTE DIASTOLIC and \\nSYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE WItH ACUTE EXACERBATION\\nThe patient has a known prior AMI with persistent wall motion \\nabnormality confirmed on. this admission, in addition to \\nimpaired relaxation consistent with diastolic heart failure.  \\nShe presents with ___ edema, hypoxia and shortness of breath \\nattributed to an exacerbation, in the setting pf recently \\nstarted axitinib. Given her underlying CHD, she has reportedly \\nhad similar presentations at the time of initiating prior \\nchemotherapy courses with agents in this class.  \\n\\nThe patient noted she had failed recent attempts at escalating \\ndoses of furosemide orally at home, with doses up to 60 -100 mg \\nof oral furosemide and ongoing symptoms. The patient has \\ndiuresed effectively this admission with IV doses between 20 and \\n40mg, and her hypoxia, dyspnea and ___ edema gradually improved. \\nGiven her single kidney, diuresis was attempted at a moderate \\nbut not excessive rate of net 1liter negative daily.\\n\\nAn echo performed this admission revealed a low-normal EF, with \\nan area of persistent WMA and evidence of diastolic dysfunction \\nand impaired relaxation.\\n\\nSecondary: 401.1 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN \\nWhile her blood pressure on presentation were remarkably \\nelevated, they improved with aggressive diureses and \\nre-initiation of lisinopril, which had apparently been stopped \\nrecently. The patient achieved a BP of 140-150/60-70 with her \\nhome regimen, once improved volume status was achieved.  Ongoing \\nefforts to determine an approprtiate oral furosemide regimen \\nwill help mitigate the risk of recurrent HF exacerbations. The \\npatient remained on her beta-blocker, lisinopril and IV \\nfurosemide during the admission.\\n\\nOf note, at the time of diagnosis with the UTI as well as during \\nthe nausea and vomiting associated with the oral phosphorus \\ntreatments, diuresis was held to avoid dehydration.\\n\\nSecondary:  Nausea\\nShe has chronic nausea, of unclear etiology.  Initially this was \\nattributed to UTI, although very minor evidence of infection in \\nurine, and then to phosphorus supplements, which may have \\nexacerbated the symptoms, but despite these interventions, she \\ncontinued to feel nauseated.  She likely has a component of \\nnausea related to chronic narcotic use, and resultant \\nconstipation.  She was advised to decreased her narcotic use \\nslowly.  If nausea persists, she will contact dr. ___ \\nconsider decadron treatment.\\n\\nSecondary: 189.0 MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, KIDNEY \\nSecondary: ___ METASTASIS TO BONE AND/OR MARROW \\nSecondary: ___ METASTASIS TO LUNG \\nSecondary: ___ METASTASIS TO LIVER \\nSecondary: ___ METASTASIS TO ADRENAL GLAND \\nThe patient started therapy with axitinib 6 days prior to \\nadmission, with improvement in her serum calcium which is \\nhopeful for disease improvement, per discussion with her \\noncologist.  This agent was held for the first portion of her \\nadmission, until her BP and volume were adequately controlled, \\nand the patient subsequently tolerated the therapy quite well in \\nterms of BP and CHF symptoms.\\n\\nSecondary: 427.31 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION \\nThe patient was continued on her amiodarone and beta-blocker \\nduring the admission.  Her oncologist noted that she had \\ntachyarrhythmias in the past during her chemotherapy, which were \\nnot noted on telemetry during this admission.\\n\\nThe patient\\'s warfarin was initially held, while her INR was \\nabove 4, and was restarted when her INR fell below 3. She \\nremained therapeutic throughout the admission.\\n\\nSecondary: 338.3 PAIN, NEOPLASM RELATED \\nThe patient was continued on her home doses of fentanyl and oral \\nhydromorphone. Of note, the patient reports a topical reaction \\nto some fentanyl patches, and therefore used her own during the \\nadmission without difficulty.\\n\\nSecondary: 272.4 HYPERLIPIDEMIA \\nHer home statin was continued without change.\\n\\nSecondary: 414.00 CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS OF UNSPECIFIED TYPE \\nOF VESSEL NATIVE \\nThe patient is known to have had a prior MI with persistent WMA. \\nShe was continued on her home ASA dose, statin, and bblocker.\\n\\nSecondary: 530.11 GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) \\nShe was continued on her home PPI.\\n\\nSecondary: 311 DEPRESSION, NOS \\nWe ontinued her home SSRI and klonopin.\\n\\nSecondary: 780.52 INSOMNIA, UNSPECIFIED \\nWe continued her home ambien and ativan.\\n\\nSecondary: 275.3 HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA/HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA \\nSecondary: 276.8 HYPOKALEMIA \\nAs noted above, the patient required aggressive electrolyte \\nrepletion. In particular, she was noted to have hypophosphatemia \\nand deferred neurta-phos due to concerns regarding liquid oral \\nmedications and nausea. She initially deferred IV repletion as \\nwell, and as a result was offered oral pills of phosphorus. She \\nthen developed profound nausea and vomiting, as well as \\ndiarrhea, which did not respond to oral or IV antiemetics. This \\ntherapy was discontinued, IV potassium phosphorus was \\nadministered, and rhe patient\\'s symptoms were noted to resolve.\\n\\nCode Status: FULL CODE discussed with patient in the presence of \\nher son. She would like one attempt at resusciation but when its \\nclear that she will have to remain on breathing machine.                                                \\t___ is a [UNKNOWN AGE] year old [UNKNOWN SEX] presenting to the ED with SOB.

He \\ncame in from rehab and was noted to have elevated LFTs but was \\nafebrile and hemodynamically stable.  Although the patient had \\nno signs or symptoms of cholangitis, and a total bilirubin of \\n0.6, because ERCP was planned for ___, plan was to \\nhave ERCP done while admitted.  \\n.\\nThe patient was admitted to the transplant surgery service, GI \\nERCP was consulted, a CT of the chest without contrast was \\nobtained, and labs were trended.  CT chest revealed small \\nbilateral pleural effusions and dense bilateral consolidations \\nwhich possibly represented early atelectasis or pneumonia.  \\nBecause of risk of hospital acquired pneumonia, broad spectrum \\nantibiotics were initiated. The patient intermittently went into \\natrial fibrillation with systolic blood pressures in the ___. A \\nsurface echo was obtained which revealed an ejection fraction of \\n21%, a significant decrease from prior.  Pulmonary embolism was \\nruled out. Physical exam was notable for pitting lower extremity \\nedema and a BNP on admission was 19k. \\n.\\nOn Hospital day #2, ERCP was performed with plastic stent \\nexchange.  After the procedure, the patient was noted to be \\napneic and bradycardic to the ___ with blood oxygen \\ndesaturation, and the patient was admitted to the SICU.

His low blood pressure was unable to \\ntolerate aggressive diuresis and he was minimally net negative \\nduring his first 2 days in the SICU.  Repeat BNP found his level \\nto be 25k, up from 19k on admission.  He was diuresed with Lasix \\nand acetazolamide.  His respiratory status improved and he was \\nextubated.  He was fed with tube feeds, which were eventually \\ncycled, and once cycled he took in more oral intake during the \\nday.  His LFTs continued to downtrend. \\n.\\nHe received tacrolimus titrated for a goal of ___, and Coumadin \\nfor goal INR ___.  His INR began to decrease and fell below 2, \\nthus a bivalirudin drip was started.  On ___ the patient had \\nno further ICU needs and was transferred to the floor in fair \\ncondition, in the floor patient was placed on 20mg of standing \\nPO Lasix, with the plan to add additional IV doses if needed. \\nThis was ultimately transitioned to PO Torsemide with an \\nexcellent increased response in urine output with weight \\ndecreasing to below 100 kg, first time since admission.

No evidence of bleeding \\nfrom oral cavity lesion. ENT biopsied lesion on ___ and path is \\npending.\\n\\n# Ventral wall hernia with herniation of surrounding fat \\nstranding concerning for incarceration. There is no \\nincarceration of bowel. Likely incisional hernia in the setting \\nof prior abdominal surgery. Surgery does not identify need for \\nsurgical intervention at this time. Most incisional hernias \\nshould be repaired, due to risk of incarceration, unless they \\nare very small (<1 cm), very large (>7 to 8 cm). During hospital \\ncourse, symptoms of pain were treated symptomatically with \\ntylenol. \\n \\n# Chest pain: denied any chest pain during FICU course.

to an acute hemorrhagic stroke in the left \\nthalamus with intraventricular extension. He also has history of \\nleft basal ganglia hemorrhage and right basal ganglia hemorrhage \\nin ___ and ___. His stroke was most likely secondary to poorly \\ncontrolled hypertension. His blood pressure was controlled with \\nlabetalol, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide. His lisinopril \\nwas discontinued due to acute kidney injury. \\nHis deficits on discharge were mild right arm and leg weakness. \\nHis stroke risk factors include the following:  \\n 1) DM: A1c 5.9%  \\n 2) Hyperlipidemia: LDL 177  \\n\\n#left thalamic intraparencyhmal hemorrhage complicated by \\nintraventicualr extension \\nSevere hypertension (blood pressure 221/118 in the emergency \\ndepartment ) at time of presentation. ___ institute of \\nhealth stroke scale 7, ___ coma scale 15, Intracerebral \\nhemorrhage volume 2.1mm3, Intracerebral hemorrhage score 1, \\npre-Intracerebral hemorrhage modified rankin score 3 based on \\nadditional history provided by his family. His exam on admission \\nwas notable for right upper extremity weakness (more pronounced \\ndistally) and right lower extremity weakness (more proximal). He \\nalso had slowed cognitive processing which was worse than new \\nbaseline since previous strokes although degree of cognitive \\nimpairment unknown. He was initially admitted to the neuro-ICU \\nfor close monitoring. His blood pressure was controlled with \\nNicardipine IV continuous infusion for a goal Systolic blood \\npressure<160. Repeat non-con head CT was without evolution of \\nhemorrhage. MRI showed known left subacute thalamic hemorrhage \\nwith intraventricular blood products and right parafalcine \\nsubacute infarct. In the setting of unclear baseline cognition \\nand concern for altered mental status, non contrast head CT was \\nrepeated and stable. EEG was obtained which showed no seizures, \\nbut had evidence of mild to moderate encephalopathy which may be \\nchronic. He received physical and occupational therapy \\nthroughout admission. \\n\\n#Hyperlipidemia \\nHis LDL was 177. Atorvastatin was initially held in the acute \\nsetting of his IPH and then started at 40 mg daily.\\n\\n#Refractory hypertension\\nIn the ICU, his blood pressure was controlled with a regimen \\nwhich included labetalol, amlodipine, hydralazine, \\nhydrochlorothiazide, and captopril. He was weaned from the \\nNiCARdipine infusion on this regimen and was stabilized on \\namlodipine, HCTZ, Lisinopril and labetalol. Labetalol was \\ndecreased in the setting of low heart rates. Lisinopril was \\nstopped in the setting of elevated creatinine and renal \\nhypoperfusion secondary to relative hypotension. \\nHydrochlorathiazine was decreased in the setting of acute renal \\ninjury. His blood pressure remained within goal 120s-140s SBP on \\namlodipine, labetalol and Hydrochlorathiazide.\\n\\nNephrology, medicine, and endocrinology consulting teams were \\ninvolved in evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension. \\nRenal ultrasound was negative for renal artery stenosis. \\nAldosterone:renin ratio was within normal range making \\nhyperaldosteronism unlikely. His urine metanephrines were \\nelevated initially however they were obtained while hypertensive \\nso were difficult to interpret. 24 hr urine total metanephrines \\nwere repeated and notable for Normetanephrines 571 (normal \\nrange) and metanephrines 251 (slightly elevated), which were \\nultimately felt NOT to be consistent with pheochromocytoma. To \\nevaluate for hypercortisolemia 24 hr urine free cortisol and Cr \\nwere obtained which were 11.3 and 1.88, respectively (normal \\nrange). Serum DHEAS and cortisol were normal. Bilateral adrenal \\nhyperplasia was seen on imaging so he was screened for non \\nclassic Congenital adrenal hyperplasia but 17OH progresterone \\nwas normal so this is unlikely. \\n\\nHis blood pressure regimen at time of discharge was: amlodipine \\n10mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily, and labetalol 300mg \\ntwice daily. \\n\\n#Acute Kidney Injury  \\nHis labs on admission were notable for an acute kidney injury \\n(Cr 1.4) that was likely pre-renal and possibly related to IV \\ncontrast. This resolved with gentle hydration. Later on during \\nadmission he again developed renal injury with elevated \\ncreatinine that was not fluid responsive. This was thought to be \\nsecondary to contrast induced nephropathy in the setting of \\nrelative hypotension given improved blood pressure control with \\naggressive medical management. Lisinopril was stopped. HCTZ was \\ndecreased. Renal ultrasound was repeated and showed no evidence \\nof hydronephrosis. SPEP and UPEP were negative. Creatinine down \\ntrended with increased renal perfusion and was 1.6 on day of \\ndischarge.\\n\\n#Positive urinalysis\\nReceived Bactrim x 1 which was stopped in the setting of \\nnegative urine culture. \\n\\n#Bright red blood per rectum\\nPatient had 2 episodes of bright red blood on defecation with \\nhard stools and straining. He was started on stool softeners as \\nwell as topical creams and gels for likely external hemorrhoids.                                                \\t___ is a 45 year old M presenting to the ED with Altered mental status, Transfer. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Neuro Surgical Intensive Care Unit (Neuro SICU) and then visited Neuro Intermediate, Neurology, Emergency Department, Neuro Intermediate. Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in hemisphere, subcortical, Acute kidney failure with tubular necrosis, Hemiplegia, unspecified affecting right dominant side, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Hypertensive emergency, Coma scale, best motor response, obeys commands, at arrival to emergency department, Coma scale,

He was prepping for an EGD/colonoscopy b/c of \\nvarices and found his glucose this morning was elevated to above \\n500. He was sent to the FICU and treated for DKA.\\n\\nACTIVE ISSUES \\n=============\\n\\n#DKA: Trigger was likely medication non-compliance. Patient had \\na fasting glucose the morning of presentation of 500 and repeat \\nglucose of > 700 in the ED. There was some confusion as to when \\nhis last dose of lantus was (seemed to be at least more than one \\nday), and his wife reported a history of medication \\nnon-compliance. No hx of DKA in the past. Initial pH 7.16, HCO3 \\n10, lactate 2.9, UA with 150 ketones, AGap 49, and glucose 726. \\nHemoglobin A1c was 11.9. Infectious workup was negative. The \\npatient was started on IVF and an insulin drip, with which he \\nwas treated until his anion gap closed. He was then transitioned \\nto 20 U Lantus and Humalog sliding scale. ___ \\nwas consulted and followed Mr. ___ throughout his stay. ___ \\nnurse educators met with him and discussed his diabetes \\nmanagement. At his time of discharge from the ICU, they had \\ndevised plan for his insulin regimen.

He said he wished to \\nspeak with his wife about finding a provider closer to his home. \\nOn day of discharge, he noted\\nthat because he could not sleep, he continually ate overnight \\nand did not receive insulin. FSG in AM was in 400s, which \\nresponded to insulin to 100s. Patient was then hypoglycemic to \\n___. He was advised to stay in house given labile FSGs and \\nrecent DKA, but insisted that he would leave as he was unable to \\ntolerate being in the\\nhospital anymore due to his mental health. Patient demonstrated \\ncapacity and chose to leave AMA as above. Discussed need to \\nfollow up with endocrine as outpatient\\nparticularly for education with regards to regimen adjustments \\nwith medical procedures, plan to arrange outpatient endocrine \\nclose to patients home. Discharged with insulin dosing per \\n___ recs. \\n\\n#Thrombocytopenia: Per report patient has a history of \\nthrombocytopenia during past hospitalizations, though platelets \\nwere lower on this admission than any time before in ___ \\nrecord and wife is unaware of hx of thrombocytopenia. Though \\ncell lines dropped significantly from admission (WBC 11.7->3.0), \\nlargely remained stable after volume repletion in the setting of \\nhypovolemia from DKA and values seen may be new baseline.  The \\npatient was placed on lovenox about 5 days before being admitted \\nto the hospital as bridge, and his platelets fell from around \\n175 at admission to 65 by 8 days after beginning lovenox. PD4 \\nantibody was sent and was negative. 4T score ___ but HIT  ruled \\nout by negative PF4 antibody. Given extensive alcohol hx, likely \\nbone marrow suppression especially given low reticulocyte index \\nof 1.7. MRCP showed no evidence of cirrhosis but patient does \\nhave large spleen which could cause sequestration. Viral marrow \\nsuppression also possible no evidence of viral syndrome and diff \\nnormal. Labs not consistent with hemolysis/consumption. Tech \\nsmear unremarkable.

He expressed understanding of the risks of leaving \\nthe hospital against medical advice, including the possibility \\nof as bleeding or infection given pancytopenia. \\n\\n#Psychiatric issues: Psych consulted due to agitation and \\nbehavioral issues present during his hospitalization. He \\nrequired ativan for agitation and refused to take his \\nmedications on multiple occasions. Seemed to be upset and \\ntremulous during interviews and was concerned that people were \\nlying to him. Evaluated and determined to be competent to make \\nmedical decisions per Psych. Cognitive testing was ok. His \\nsymptoms were thought possibly due to withdrawl from Effexor, \\nalcohol or marijuana but not clearly defined. Recommendation was \\nto pursue further outpatient psychiatry evaluation, notably for \\nschizophrenia as he displayed some symptoms of this diagnosis \\nand his mother has schizophrenia.  On day of discharge, patient \\nwas angry because he thinks that he did not receive his \\ntrazodone from the RN overnight though it was documented in the \\n___.

He was \\nunable to have a biopsy performed given lovenox administration \\nthat morning. He will need a repeat EGD in 1 month as an \\noutpatient with biopsy. He was started on omeprazole 40mg BID. \\nHe also had a colonoscopy done at this time which was normal \\nwith recommended ___ year follow up.  \\n\\n#Chronic EtOH: Patient reported history of heavy alcohol use and \\nchronic pancreatitis. He says he has not been drinking recently. \\nSerum ethanol was negative, and lipase was 22. Per wife, pt has \\na hx of DTs. Patient was placed on ___ protocol and ordered for \\nLorazepam PRN but did not score. He did not suffer from DTs. \\n\\n#Elevated Cr: Likely pre-renal due to fluid loss in DKA. \\nImproved with IVF. \\n\\n#Splenic thrombosis on AC. Coumadin had  been held for 5 days \\nand bridged to lovenox for his planned EGD/colonoscopy. Lovenox \\nwas continued initially and continued on discharge while \\nbridging to Coumadin following his EGD/colonoscopy.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES \\n===================\\n# ___: Will need repeat EGD in 1 month as outpatient with \\nbiopsy. Ordered in OMR. PCP ___. Will need to be off warfarin \\nprior to procedure. \\n# Splenic Vein Thrombus \\n- INR 0.9 on discharge. Next INR to be checked on ___.

HCV, NASH, cirrhosis s/p TIPS, \\ncomplicated by hepatorenal syndrome, on HD via tunneled RIJ HD \\nline MWF, who presents from HD with hypotension.  \\n\\n# GOALS OF CARE:  Patient had been started on hemodialysis as a \\nbridge to dual liver and kidney transplant, however given severe \\ndeconditioning and malnutrition, patient is no longer eligible \\nfor transplantion. After extensive discussion with the patient \\nand her family, the decision was made to transition to \\ncomfort-focused care with home hospice. All medications not \\ncontributory to comfort were discontinued at the time of \\ndischarge. The patient and her family are encouraged to discuss \\nwith the hospice nurse any questions they may have regarding \\nmedications and treatments after discharge.\\n\\n# HYPOTENSION: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of low baseline \\nblood pressures, recent paracentesis without albumin, and \\nhemodialysis, and report of poor PO intake.  Empirically covered \\nfor sepsis with vanc/zosyn, but promptly discontinued when \\nmental status recovered and studies were not suggestive of \\ninfectious process.  She was fluid resuscitated with albumin and \\nplatelets, and continued on home midodrine. She continued to \\nbecome intermittently hypotensive during dialysis days, and this \\nappears to be secondary to fluid shift and would respond to \\nmidodrine. Her midodrine was continued at discharge for comfort \\nas intermittent hypotension would contribute to patient \\nconfusion and anxiety.\\n\\n# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Most likely toxic-metabolic \\nencephalopathy given the prominence of somnolence and the \\npresence of asterixis.  Given the time course, lorazepam she \\nreceived in emergency department was likely a key precipitant.   \\nGiven coagulopathy, a head CT was checked, which was negative \\nfor intracranial bleed.  Mental status improved to baseline \\nseveral hours after administration of lorazepam.  Continued \\nlactulose, and patient should continue this after discharge as \\nshe wishes.\\n\\n# Thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy: Likely secondary to cirrhosis \\nand splenic sequestration. More pronounced thrombocytopenia \\ncompared to prior.  Abdominal ultrasound with doppler revealed \\npatent TIPS and no evidence of portal thrombosis.  He received \\n1U platelets in the ED with appropriate rise.  Clinical evidence \\nof bleeding include epistaxis, conjunctival hemorrhage, oozing \\nfrom dialysis line, hemorrhagic ascites. She was transfused 1u \\ncryoprecipitate for fibrinogen < 100. Her hemodialysis line was \\npulled and patient monitored for any signs of post-procedure \\nbleeding prior to discharge.\\n\\n# Cirrhosis ___ HCV, ___:  Acutely decompensated by \\nthrombocytopenia, encephalopathy, elevated T. bili, ascites.  \\nShe was continued on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, ursodiol, \\nlactulose, and rifaximin during this hospitalization. Given she \\nis not a transplant candidate, goals of care discussion was held \\nas discussed above. She is discharged on lactulose for comfort \\nand maintenance of mental status, as mentioned above.\\n\\n# ESRD on HD: MWF. Unable to complete HD on day of admission \\nsecondary to hypotension. Continued MWF dialylsis and supportive \\nmedications. Dialysis was discontinued after goals of care \\ndiscussion as this did not seem to symptomatically improve the \\npatient. Hemodialysis catheter pulled prior to discharge.\\n\\n# GERD: continued omeprazole.  \\n\\n# Depression: continued citalopram.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n# Code: DNR/DNI\\n# Communication: Patient, ___ (son) contact: ___ cell \\n___ alt ___ (son) ___, cell \\n___ and daughter ___ ___                                                \\t___ is a 65 year old F presenting to the ED with Hypotension. Over the course of her hospital course, ___ started at Medicine and then visited Medicine, Emergency Department, Trauma SICU (TSICU). Over the course of their hospital stay, her was given the following diagnoses: Hypotension, unspecified, End stage renal disease, Toxic encephalopathy, Other and unspecified coagulation defects, Unspecified protein-calorie malnutrition, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with chronic kidney disease stage V or end stage renal disease, Other ascites, Encounter for palliative care, Depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified, Esophageal reflux, Thrombocytopenia, unspecified, Unspecified viral hepatitis C without hepatic coma, Cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol, Nontoxic uninodular goiter, Anxiety state, unspecified, Obesity, unspecified, Osteoporosis, unspecified, Do not resuscitate status, Renal dialysis status in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures: Percutaneous abdominal drainage in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications:\\n40577\\t40593\\t20762654\\tHe was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team with a  right \\ntemporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, left distal clavicle \\nfracture, left rib fractures ___, moderate left pneumothorax and \\nspinous process fractures T3,4. he was transferred to the  \\nTrauma ICU for close monitoring and  hourly neuro checks. \\n\\nOrthopedic and Neurosurgery were consulted and non-operative \\nmanagements were recommended. He was placed in a sling for the \\nclavicle fracture and is non weight bearing but may actively and \\npassively have range of motion exercises. He was started on \\nKeppra for seizure prophylaxis for a total of 7 days and will \\nfollow up in 1 month in ___ clinic for repeat head CT. \\nHe is neurologically intact- awake, alert and oriented x3 \\nwithout any observed or reported seizure activity. He was doing \\nwell on hospital day #2 and transferred to regular floor.  \\n\\nOnce transferred out of the ICU he progressed slowly primarily \\nlimited by pain and deconditioned status from being in the ICU. \\nHis pain medications were adjusted and an adequate oral pain \\nregimen was eventually in place. \\n\\nHe was also treated for a urinary tract infection with Cipro for \\n5 day course. Sensitivites were pending at time of discharge. \\nWill plan to contact rehab facility once this data is available \\nin the event that therapy needs to be changed.\\n\\nHe was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is \\nbeing recommended for discharge to rehab after his acute \\nhospital stay.                                                \\t___ is a 53 year old M presenting to the ED with SAH. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Med/Surg/Trauma and then visited Emergency Department, Trauma SICU (TSICU). Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Other and unspecified intracranial hemorrhage following injury without mention of open intracranial wound, with concussion, unspecified, Urinary tract infection, site not specified, Closed fracture of six ribs, Closed fracture of dorsal [thoracic] vertebra without mention of spinal cord injury, Pedal cycle accident injuring pedal cyclist, Closed fracture of acromial end of clavicle in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures:  in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications:\\n40667\\t40683\\t20070635\\t___ with history of HTN, HLD, DM2 who presents with 7 hours of \\nchest discomfort and lightheadedness.  \\n\\n# Chest discomfort: Patient presented with chest discomfort to \\nthe ED with negative ACS workup based on negative cardiac \\nenzymes x 3 and EKG.  He was admitted for overnight telemetry \\nmonitoring and stress echocardiogram testing which was also \\nnegative.  He had no CXR evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax \\nand had a negative D-dimer with a low well\\'s score.  His \\nsymptoms were not associated with positional changes or \\npleuritic in nature.  He had no tenderness to palpation over the \\nchest wall, making costochondritis less likely and it was \\nthought his symptoms were secondary to anxiety.  His pain was \\nmanaged with tylenol and he was started on aspirin and continued \\non statin.  He was reassured and discharged with close PCP \\nfollow up. \\n\\n# Elevated Lactate: His lactate was mildly elevated at 3 with no \\nclinical evidence of hypoperfusion.  His metformin was held and \\ndiscontinued at discharge.  \\n\\n# DM: Metformin was held and he was on an ISS during hospital \\ncourse and started on glipizide given lactate elevation which \\nwas thought secondary to metformin.  PCP was informed regarding \\nthis change and patient was instructed to monitor his BS at home \\non glipizide to monitor for hypo or hyperglycemia. \\n\\n# HTN:  Normotensive and continued on home lisinopril.  \\n\\n# HLD: He was on atorvastatin during hospital course then \\nrestarted on home simvastatin at discharge.                                                \\t___ is a 43 year old M presenting to the ED with Chest pain.

Hospitalization was complicated by persistent \\nhypotension without evidence of end-organ perfusion which was \\npresumed new baseline, low back pain from sacral ulcer and \\nosteomyelitis requiring narcotics, and poor nutrition. \\n\\nACTIVE ISSUES\\n\\n# Sepsis, resolved\\nHe was transferred from rehab to ___ for fevers and altered \\nmental status; found to have leukocytosis and hypotension. \\nInitially suspected intrahepatic fluid collection as source. Pt \\nhas recent h/o cholecystitis s/p perc drain with evidence of \\nintrahepatic fluid collection on imaging; however, drain \\nappeared to be in place and draining. Per discussion with ___, \\nfluid collection was more suggestive of hematoma or biloma \\nrather than abscess given position.  Differential also included \\nosteomyelitis in setting of large sacral decubitus ulcer with \\nexposed bone (see further discussion below) or urinary tract (UA \\nwith 181 WBCs, few bact, lg leukocyte esterase though culture \\nnegative in this pt with a h/o recurrent UTIs/urosepsis). Urine \\nculture and blood cultures were negative; C. diff negative x 3. \\nInitially admitted to the MICU and started on vancomycin and \\npiperacillin/tazobactam, changed to vanc/meropenem out of \\nconcern for resistant organisms given recent cepefime use.  \\nAntibiotics were narrowed to cefepime/metronidazole due to \\nsuspicion for intrahepatic fluid collection as focus of \\ninfection and then transitioned to TMP-SMX/PO metronidazole (the \\ncombination he had been on upon discharge from his prior \\nhospitalization).  Interventional Radiology examined imaging and \\nfound intrahepatic fluid collection to be small, not requiring \\ndrainage.  He developed low-grade leukocytosis and the platelet \\ncount uptrended, which renewed suspicion for an untreated \\ninfection. Osteomyelitis was pursued as the focus of infection, \\nas described below and antibiotics were tailored accordingly. \\n\\n# Osteomyelitis from Sacral decubitus ulcer:\\nPt had stage 4 ulcer on sacrum with exposed bone s/p bedside \\ndebridement by ACS ___ and ___.  BP remained low, he \\ndeveloped low-grade leukocytosis, and platelet count uptrended, \\nwhich renewed suspicion for an untreated infection. \\nOsteomyelitis was suspected clinically and demonstrated on MRI \\nof the pelvis. Infectious Disease was consulted, who agreed with \\nobtaining a bone biopsy in order to culture the pathogen to \\nallow for targeting antibiotics.  TMP/SMX and metronidzole were \\ncontinued while awaiting bone biopsy so as not to decrease the \\nyield of the culture by broadening antibiotics.  A bone biopsy \\nwas obtained on ___ and culture showed corynebacterium \\nsensitive to vancomycin, and per ID his final antibiotic course \\nis vancomycin and cipofloxacin for a total of 6 weeks, to end \\n___. He will follow up with the ___ clinic at 2 weeks and 6 \\nweeks during his course for antibiotic monitoring. Please check \\nvancomycin trough ___ AM and re-dose for goal ___. Please \\ncheck weekly (starting on ___ CBC with differential, \\nChem7, LFTs, vancomycin trough, ESR, CRP and fax to ___ \\n___ to the ___ R.N.s at ___. All \\nquestions regarding outpatient parenteral antibiotics should be \\ndirected to the ___ R.N.s at ___ or to \\nthe on-call ID fellow when the clinic is closed. He had a PICC \\nline placed in ___ on ___ with the preliminary report noting: \\n\"Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line exchange for a \\nnew 4 ___ single-lumen PICC line. Final internal length is 43 \\ncm, with the tip positioned in the SVC. The line is ready to \\nuse.\" \\n\\n# Sacral decubitus ulcer:\\nStage 4 ulcer on sacrum with exposed bone. S/p bedside \\ndebridement by ACS ___, and ___. Per report from \\ninitial debridement, there was no probing to bone; however, bone \\nwas clearly exposed by the time of the second debridement.  \\nWork-up and treatment of osteomyelitis was undertaken, as \\ndescribed above.  Continued wound care as per Wound Nurse recs \\n___ see ___ 1 of discharge paperwork).  Continued to \\nencourage adequate nutrition.  Pt was evaluated by Nutrition \\nwhile inpatient and started on vitamin C and zinc sulfate.  He \\nhas a follow-up with Surgery after discharge for further \\nevaluation/management and consideration of referral to Plastic \\nSurgery for consideration of skin or muscle flap if indicated.\\n\\n# Hypotension:\\nHe was persistently hypotensive with SBP in ___. \\nMultifactorial, including low baseline BP in combination with \\nsepsis and severely low EF. This was not clearly related to \\nsepsis as he remained with low BPs above even without fevers or \\nleukocytosis. AM cortisol was 6.3. He received small fluid \\nboluses (250cc NS over 30 minutes) throughout his \\nhospitalization when SBP < 80, but during all of these episodes \\nhe remained asymptomatic without evidence of poor organ \\nperfusion and no concern for recurrent sepsis. This was not \\nclearly related to his narcotics, but uptitration of narcotics \\n(if needed) should be monitored carefully given the potential \\nfor further hypotension.\\n\\n# Back pain:\\nDue to large sacral decubitus ulcer plus immobility. Pt also has \\nh/o chronic pain.  Morphine SR was uptitrated to 75mg BID, and \\nhis oxycodone was changed to Morphine ___ for breakthrough pain.  \\nThough initially held, he was restarted on gabapentin ___. \\nShould be cautious with uptitration pain medications as they may \\ncontribute to low BP.\\n\\n# Cholecystitis s/p percuctaneous cholecystostomy placement:\\nDrain was in proper place and patent, but cystic duct was \\nobstructed per cholangio study ___. Repeat RUQ US ___ showed \\nperc chole tube extending to a partially decompressed \\ngallbladder, though the tip was not clearly seen within the \\nlumen.  The plan was to continue perc chole for 6 wks from \\n___ (till ___ per documentation from prior \\nhospitalization. LFTs were WNL and perc chole tube fell out \\n___. Repeat RUQ US was unremarkable, though technically \\nlimited. His abdominal exam remained benign after the perc chole \\ntube was removed. He has follow up with surgery (\"ACS\") after \\ndischarge for any further plans for future elective \\ncholecystectomy.  \\n\\n# DVTs on anticoagulation:\\nWarfarin had been on hold for some days at rehab and yet INR was \\n7.2 on admission, likely due to antibiotics. No signs of active \\nbleeding. Received Vitamin K. Warfarin was held temporarily in \\nanticipation for bone biopsy and restarted on ___ with heparin \\ndrip for bridging. Goal INR is ___. His INR was 3.1 upon \\ndischarge and does not require any bridging therapy.\\n\\n# Altered mental status, resolved:\\nLikely toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of \\ninfection.  Baseline mental status uncertain but pt remained \\nA&Ox3 starting from at least ___ through discharge.  Added \\nback long-acting morphine ___ to get pain under better control \\nand restarted gabapentin ___.  Pre-admission medication list \\nalso shows clonazepam, which has been on hold and discontinued \\nupon discharge.  Pt does not demonstrate or complain of anxiety, \\nbut could consider restarting clonazepam if it becomes a \\nproblem.\\n \\n# Emesis, resolved:\\nTube study ___ showed significant gastric distension. KUB \\n___ showed air-fluid levels and decompression of descending \\ncolon with rectal tube, suggestive of ileus but unable to rule \\nout SBO. CT abd/pelvis ___ was consistent with ileus.  Timing \\nof emesis did coincide with transition from ___ to \\ncefepime/metronidazole, so it could have been due to antibiotic. \\nHe was treated symptomatically with ondansetron PRN. Emesis \\nresolved.\\n\\n# Diarrhea:\\nImproved. C diff negative x 3. Flexiseal was in place for first \\npart of hospitalization but discontinued on ___. This \\ncontinued to be an intermittent issue for him but does not \\nappear to be infectious. Bowel regimen was held. \\n\\n# Goals of care:\\nPer discussion with patient\\'s brothers, he had been set up with \\nhospice at his nursing home given multiple hospitalizations, \\nvery poor overall functional status. However, patient wished to \\nbe full code and pursue aggressive treatment upon discussion \\nwith ICU team. Palliative care consulted and discussed \\nanticipated trajectory with brother ___ ___ pt declined \\nto participate.  Pt remains full code.\\n\\nCHRONIC DIAGNOSES\\n\\n# Diabetes: Held home sitagliptin in house.  We used a low dose \\ninsulin sliding scale while hospitalized but he required very \\nminimal short-acting insulin. Given his poor nutrition, his diet \\nwas liberalized from consistent carb/diabetic to regular. \\n\\n# Cardiomyopathy of uncertain etiology, EF ___:\\nHeld ACE-I, beta-blocker due to hypotension. Continued ASA.\\n\\n# Psych:\\nContinued home sertraline.\\n\\n# Presumptive h/o gout (not listed on ___ but PAML shows \\nallopurinol):\\nNo acute exacerbation of chronic disease.

EBV PCR remains pending upon discharge. \\n\\nShe was started on neupogen on ___ and her ANC was monitored.  \\nHer counts began to recover, and the medication was d/c on \\n___.  \\n\\n# Abdominal pain: \\nThe full etiology unknown, although likely secondary to probable \\ntyphilitis seen on CT.  The patient continued to report \\nintermittent abdominal pain, but did feel that some of her \\ndiscomfort was relieved by BM.  As above, she was maintained on \\nbroad spectrum antibiotics and did not experience diarrhea while \\nan inpatient.\\n\\n# Syncope: \\nPt developed syncope/near-syncope in ED while going to bathroom, \\nwhich was witnessed, with no associated trauma.  The patient did \\nnot report prodromal symptoms reported and her ECG was \\nreportedly normal.  This was most likely secondary to \\nhypovolemia in the setting of neutropenic fever.  The patient \\nhad a slightly elevated troponin with flat CK-MBs that remained \\nstable.  She was in NSR and monitored for >24 hours on telemetry \\nwithout event.  She underwent a TTE, which was a suboptimal \\nstudy, but overall was unremarkable.  A ___ CT was wnl.  Her \\nfurosemide was initially held, and restarted as the patient \\nappears to be stable.\\n\\n# Hypokalemia: \\nOn her ED labs, the patient\\'s K was noted to be 2.7.  This was \\nfelt to be likely ___ over-diuresis and inadequate repletion in \\nsetting of ongoing fevers.  Her electrolytes were repleted as \\nneeded. She was discharged on a lower dose of potassium (20mg \\nqday vs. prior 20mg BID) as her lasix was also decreased during \\nhospitalization (to 20mg qday from 40mg qday). \\n\\n# DLBCL: \\nPatient is s/p 5 cycles of R-CHOP and is ray 4 of single agent \\nRituximab (given for her ___ cycle).  A daily CBC with diff and \\nANC were monitored.  As above, she was started and continued on \\nneupogen until her counts appropriately recovered.\\n\\n# Hypertension: \\nGiven her syncopal episode in the ED, the patient\\'s furosemide \\nwas initially held and strict holding parameters were written on \\nall anti-hypertensives.  As she remained stable, her furosemide \\nwas restarted.  The patient reported that her dose was recently \\ndecreased to 20 mg po qday, although this is not entirely clear \\nfrom the records.  She was restarted on, and is to be discharged \\non, 20 mg po qday.\\n\\n# Hypercholesterolemia: \\nShe was continued on her home statin.\\n\\n# Atrial fibrillation: \\nThe patient was in NSR during her admission.  She was \\ntransitioned to short-acting metoprolol and diltiazem while \\ninpatient.\\n\\n=====================================================                                                \\t___ is a 84 year old F presenting to the ED with FEVER.

She \\nrecently had a CT of the C spine which was notable for severe \\ndegenerative changes prior to this admission. Her pain was \\nmanaged conservatively with PO pain medications and a soft \\ncollar neck brace. Due to ongoing neck pain she underwent repeat \\nCT of the C spine which was notable for relatviely acute type II \\nfracture of the dens (new since prior exam) and ossification of \\nthe posterior longitudinal ligament.  She was evaluated by Ortho \\nwho recommended conservative management with a hard collar for 2 \\nmonths. She may ultimately need to be fused Occiput to C6 or \\nC1-C6 -- but decisions regarding surgery were not made at this \\ntime. She was seen by the Pain consult service who recommended \\nadding tinazidine to her pain medications. Her pain continued to \\nbe poorly controlled so she was switched from PO pain \\nmedications to IV medications.

Neurology was consulted.  There was some \\nthought of malignant hyperthermia given succinylcholine \\nadministration but the timeline of symptoms did not seem \\nparticularly suggestive.  There was discussion of NMS secondary \\nto Haldol administration in the ED but he had been agitated \\nprior to Haldol administration. He had an LP which did not show \\nsigns of infection. EEG showed only mild encephalopathy. He had \\nno known medication changes prior to admission. It was noted by \\nNeurology consult that he is on primidone (a barbiturate) for \\nessential tremor.  Primidone\\x92s metabolites include phenobarbital \\n(commonly used anti-epileptic). If he had missed some doses of \\nthe primidone prior to ECT, it is possible that ECT with the \\nsame settings as a previous treatment would have induced more \\nseizure activity than normal, perhaps leading to a longer post \\nictal state.  His described symptoms could potentially be \\ncompatible with prolonged post ictal state (agitation, \\nconfusion).  While the exact cause of his agitation was not \\ndetermined, patient was asked to discuss whether or not to \\ncontinue ECT with his psychiatrist.  He improved over the course \\nof the ___ hours and was at his baseline (calm, cooperative, \\nAOx3) prior to discharge.\\n\\n#Fever: \\nPatient developed new onset fever while in the emergency \\ndepartment. Initial concerns were for malignant hyperthermia \\ngiven use of succinylcholine prior to ECT. However, he had no \\nother clinical signs including muscle rigidity, elevated CK, \\nhypercarbia, or electrolyte abnormalities. He received \\ndantrolene x2 in ED. Upon arrival to ICU, he continued to have \\nfever. Imaging notable for possible pneumonia vs. pneumonitis \\nfor which the patient was treated with ceftriaxone and \\nazithromycin.  Given ongoing cough, he was switched to Augmentin \\nat the time of discharge to complete a total 7 day course for \\naspiration pneumonia.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES  \\n==============  \\n# DM: Continued home glargine and standing Humalog\\n\\n# CAD: Continue ASA, Plavix\\n\\n# HLD: Continue atorvastatin                                                \\t___ is a 65 year old M presenting to the ED with Altered mental status.

He was maintained on PO amiodarone. \\nWhen hemodynamically stable, patient was started on metoprolol. \\nHis amiodarone should be decreased to 200 mg daily in 3 days.    \\n\\n\\n# Pleural effusions: We believed his effusions were contributing \\nto his respiratory status so he underwent thoracentesis ___, \\nwhich was complicated by pneumothorax, now s/p chest tube \\nplacement and removal ___ (exudative effusion, nothing growing \\nout of fluids so far, cytology normal).  Based on CT ___ he \\nhad large hematoma and hemothorax so went for VATS that day (see \\nbelow). \\n\\n# ___: baseline Cr 1, on admission was 1.2, peaked at 2.5, went \\ndown to 1.6 (Nephrology believes this was mostly from \\ncontrast-induced nephropathy and also CHF). But after \\nhypotension on ___, Cr bumped to 2.2 but slowly dropped back \\ndown to 1.2. On day of discharge, creatinine increased to 2.2 He \\nwas found to have urinary retention and a foley was placed and \\nflomax started. This could be the cause of increased creatinine. \\nTorsemide is on hold. Please perform voiding trial in 5 days and \\ncheck Chem-7 on the day after discharge. \\n\\n# Leukocytosis to peak of 55: Hematology believes this is mostly \\nreactive, but we had him on empiric antibiotics for HCAP \\ncoverage. Beta 2 microglobulin and kappa/lamda were mildly \\nelevated but again thought to be reactive. BCR-ABL was negtaive. \\nJAK 2 was negative.   With time the leukocytosis continued with \\nno clear infection so Abx were stopped ___. ___ trending down \\nsince antibiotics were discontinued. At discharge, WBC was 23.\\n\\n# Pulmonary emboli: Hematology recommended outpatient \\nhypercoagulability work-up and malignancy work-up including \\ncolonoscopy and biopsies of rectal thickening that was seen on \\nCT (you had already referred him back for colonoscopy in ___ \\nbut they feel he should have a repeat study). Patient maintained \\non heparin drip until it was discovered that he had a large \\nhemothorax, at which point heparin drip was stopped (see below). \\nBecause heparin was off for several days, IVC filter was placed \\non ___ and retrieved on ___ ___onfirmed no further \\nincrease in the size of the hematoma.\\n\\n# Hemothorax: Chest CT on ___ showed large hemothorax with \\nhematoma tracking along the right chest wall. Patient required a \\ntotal of 4 units red cells to maintain Hct > 21.  Given the \\nloculation and large hematoma seen on imaging, patient was taken \\nto the OR afternoon of ___ by thoracic surgery for removal of \\nhematoma and placement of 3 chest tubes. He tolerated the \\nprocedure well without complication. Patient\\'s heparin drip (for \\npulmonary embolism, see above) was stopped prior to going to the \\nOR. Chest tubes were removed on ___ without \\ncomplications and hematocrit remained stable. \\n \\n#Erythrocytosis: Pt without history of high H/H. Pt may be dry \\nor physiologic compensation for hypoxia (secondary \\npolycythemia). CBC trended and dropped to a low of 21.7 in the \\nsetting of hemothorax (see above). At discharge H/H was \\n9.2/29.0. \\n\\n# Hypoxic respiratory distress: Multifactorial: Large PEs, PNA, \\npulm infarct, pleural effusion and pulm edema ___ LV \\ndysfunction; improved with diuresis and thoracentesis c/b \\npneumothorax. Likely from markedly elevated filing pressures as \\nwell as possibly an element of compressive atelectasis due to \\nthe effusion. Now he is more comfortable, satting well on room \\nair.\\n\\nChronic issues: \\n#OA/DJD: Chronic, takes Aleve and Tylenol at home. Tylenol PRN \\nfor pain control in house.\\n\\n#OSA: Uses CPAP at home. Patient\\'s wife brought home CPAP in and \\novernight CPAP was continued.                                                \\t___ is a 67 year old M presenting to the ED with SOB.

Course\\n--------------\\nADMISSION THROUGH ___\\n\\nMr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with a PMH of IDDM2, CKD \\n(Baseline Cr. 1.3), HTN, HLD who presented to his outpatient \\nclinic with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, thought \\nsecondary to neuromuscular weakness NOS.\\n \\n#Acute Hypoxemic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient \\npresented with marked hypercarbia to the ED and hypoxia. He was \\nintubated with improvement in the hypercarbia. A chest x-ray was \\nnot concerning for any consolidation/pulmonary abnormalities \\nother than having low lung volumes. Patient\\'s current and \\nhistorical lab values ___ and ___ of an elevated \\nhematocrit and bicarbonate suggested a chronic and compensated \\nrespiratory acidosis. Appears the patient has been hypercarbic \\nfor a long time with a subacute deterioration. He was in a house \\nfire a week prior to admission and it is unclear if there was \\nany inhalation injury but less likely given that this would be \\nmore acute. Patient\\'s history also suggested worsening weakness \\nover the last year in his proximal leg muscles and arms. The \\npatient consistently had a negative inspiratory force of -20 to \\n-35 and was not able to be extubated. CK was normal pointing \\naway from a myositis. The most likely etiology for his \\nrespiratory failure includes an atypical presentation of ALS \\nwith bulbar predominant symptoms. A Chest CT was unremarkable. \\nNeurology was consulted and a workup for neuromuscular diseases \\nwas pursued including testing of the Acetylcholine Receptor \\nBinding Ab, MuSK Ab, ACE, ___ but these were all negative. An \\nMRI of the head was completed without any evidence suggesting a \\nclear cause of his pathology. Patient was unable to recover \\nenough respiratory function to allow for extubation so a \\ntracheostomy and PEG were placed on ___. Of note, patient \\nunexpectedly weaned to trach mask on ___ and tolerated trach \\nmask for 24 hours including ambulation with ___ without \\ndesaturations prior to discharge. At time of discharge, etiology \\nof respiratory failure remains unclear. Initially felt ___ \\nunknown NMJ disorder, however all testing unrevealing this \\nadmission. One working theory is that the patient had a baseline \\nR phrenic nerve palsy ___ prior head/neck mass excision at ___ \\nand in the setting of acute lung injury following fire, \\ndecompensated. However, this is unlikely to explain patient\\'s \\npersistant NIF of -25. Patient will follow up with neurology and \\npulmonology to further w/u etiology of respiratory failure for \\nphrenic nerve studies. \\n\\n#HCAP: Patient spiked fever on ___ with new infiltrates noted \\non CXR. Patient initiated on Vanc/Zosyn for presumed HCAP with \\nplan to complete 8 day course. Vanco stopped based on sputum \\nculture. Discharged on Zosyn through ___.\\n\\n___ on CKD: Cr baseline is 1.3 but was 1.5 on admission. Mild, \\npossibly secondary to dehydration. Resolved ___ hospital stay \\nwith return of Cr to 1.3. Home lisinopril initially held but \\nrestarted once ___ resolved. \\n\\n#Hypotension and Hypertension: Hypotensive following intubation \\nrequiring temporary levophed. Most likely secondary to sedation. \\nThis quickly resolved and patient was weaned from pressor. was \\nheld initially but restarted when ___ resolved however patient \\nbecame hypertensive with SBPs in the 160s. Amlodipine was added \\nand he remained normotensive. \\n\\n#Thrombocytopenia: Chronic issue per prior labs. Possibly in the \\nsetting of chronic disease. Stable in 70-80k. No signs of \\nbleeding. \\n\\n#IDDM2: Uncontrolled at home. Home insulin dose unknown. Home \\nmetformin was held and patient was managed with Lantus and \\nregular insulin sliding scale while in ICU. Discharged on Lantus \\n26 units and ISS with plan to reassess use of Metformin in the \\noutpatient setting.\\n \\n#Hyperlipidemia: Home statin was restarted once CK returned \\nwithin normal limits.                                                \\t___ is a 66 year old M presenting to the ED with Hypoxia.

He was \\nhypotensive in the ED and started on targeted temperature \\nmanagement and transferred to the ICU. Course notable for \\ndifficult to control tremors which caused occasional agitation. \\n\\nACUTE ISSUES\\n============\\n#Post Cardiac Arrest\\n#Respiratory Failure\\nLikely a respiratory arrest secondary to mucous plugging versus \\npossible Type I NSTEMI. Patient was cooled to 35C for 24 hours \\nand then rewarmed with return of mental status to the ability to \\nfollow commands, although not to his baseline of being alert and \\ninteractive. As he was warmed he was monitored on EEG and \\nintermittently displayed signs of tremor that were concerning \\nfor possible seizure activity but per evaluation on EEG were not \\nconsistent with seizure activity. At time of discharge, mental \\nstatus had improved and patient was able to follow simple \\ncommands and answer simple (yes/no) questions. \\n\\n#Agitation\\n#AMS\\nMultifactorial, has baseline dementia with delirium from \\nprolonged hospital/rehab courses. Now with a likely \\ntoxic-metabolic encephalopathy component from cardiac arrest. \\nAgitation was treated initially with precedex which was \\neventually changed to Seroquel. \\n\\n#Tremor \\nPropranolol and Primidone restarted for tremor.\\n\\n#NSTEMI\\nTroponins elevated with peak at 0.64. Cardiology consulted, but \\ngiven recent neurosurgery recommended against heparin gtt. \\nContinued on ASA/Statin.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n==============\\n#Complicated UTI\\nGrew MDR pseudomonas and VRE at ___ on ___, also with \\npositive blood cultures. Was on Ceftolozane-Tazobactam on \\nadmission, transitioned to Ceftaz and Linezolid here based on \\nmicro data from Rehab to complete a 14 day course.\\n\\n#___\\nHad ___ in ___ requiring multiple surgical interventions at \\n___ and ___, with most recent surgery in early ___. Given \\nNSTEMI, neurosurgery was consulted and recommended against \\nheparin gtt use.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n[ ] Draw BCX/UCX on last day of antibiotics (___) to ensure \\nadequate treatment given culture data suggesting intermediate \\nresponse to Ceftazidime.\\n[ ] Held amlodipine & hydralazine i/s/o hypotension. As blood \\npressure improves, should restart.\\n[ ] If tremor fails to improve with propranolol & primidone, \\npatient should be evaluated by neurology.\\n[ ] Discharged w PICC for IV abx. \\n[ ] Seroquel started for agitation and delirium. Given ongoing \\ndelirium, continued at time of discharge, but this should be \\nweaned as delirium improves.                                                \\t___ is a 86 year old M presenting to the ED with Unresponsive. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Trauma SICU (TSICU) and then visited Emergency Department. Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, Cardiac arrest due to underlying cardiac condition, Nontraumatic chronic subdural hemorrhage, Acute and chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia, Delirium due to known physiological condition, Urinary tract infection, site not specified, Encephalopathy, unspecified,

admission for \\npostrenal failure (due to bladder dysfunction) with chronic \\nfoley presents with chronic worsening lower extremity edema, and \\nworsening abdominal distention concerning for heart failure. \\nEcho results consistent with sCHF with LVEF ___. Diuresed on \\nlasix gtt with ~25L fluid reduction and return to dry weight \\n~200lbs. Patient was entirely symptom free throughout stay. \\nDischarged to ___ facility due to marked family concern for pt \\nmed compliance and safety at home.\\n\\nActive Issues:  \\n# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: He was significantly \\nvolume overload on admisison with ~50lb increase from dry weight \\nover several month period. BNP on admission ___. No history of \\ndietary indiscretion, ischemic symptoms (although diabetic), \\ninfection, or other destabilizing forces. Thought be progression \\nof cardiac disease. DVT was ruled out with LENIS. MI was ruled \\nout with serial troponins and EKG. Echo showed right sided heart \\nfailure worrisome for a infiltrative process such as amyloid. \\nSPEP/UPEP, and serum free light chains checked to evaluate for \\nAL, however, these were negative. Patient was aggresively \\ndiuresed on the general medicine service, but did not respond to \\n80mg IV lasix TID. He was transferred to the cardiology service \\nto start lasix gtt. He responded quite well to this and \\nmetolazone. Only received several doses of metolazone, but kept \\non lasix gtt until he returned to his dry weight of ~200lbs. He \\ndenied any SOB, DOE, orthopnea, or PND during this time. Lung \\nexam significant for bibasilar crackles that improved with \\ndiuresis. After adequate diuresis, his BLE went from 3+ pitting \\nedema with tense bullae to 1+ edema with no bullae. Once close \\nto euvolemia, he was switched back to home dose of torsemide \\n80mg qday and monitored for 24 hours. Continued to diurese on \\nthis medication. Given his likely infiltrative cardiomyopathy, \\nhe will need cardiac MR as outpatient for ___ evaluation. \\n.\\n# Troponinemia: Elevated to a peak of 0.1 then trended down, \\nCKMB normal. EKG shows nonspecific ST and T wave changes, but no \\nsignificant abnormalities. No anginal symptoms. Likely secondary \\nto heart strain from CHF and decreased clearance with underlying \\nCKD. \\n.\\n# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 4. Not on coumadin on \\nadmission due to fall risk. As risk of atrial thrombus greatly \\nincreased in both amyloid and acute heart failure, the decision \\nwas made to restart coumadin. He tolerated this well. Pt had \\nseveral episodes of asymptomatic bradycardia while on carvedilol \\n25mg BID. This dose was reduced to 12.5mg BID and bradycardia \\nresolved.\\n.\\n# UTI: Urine cultures on admission growing pansensitive E. Coli \\nin setting of chronic foley usage. Treating with 14 day course \\nof cefpodoxime for complicated UTI in male (day ___.\\n  \\n# CKD, Stage III: Patient presenting with stable Cr. Etiology of \\nCKD thought to be ___ HTN, however, may be result of amyloid \\ngiven restrictive cardiomyopathy. SPEP/UPEP and serum free light \\nchains were checked to evaluate for amyloidosis, as above, which \\nwere negative.\\n.\\n# Hypertension: BPs were elevated to 160s systolic. Lisinopril \\nwas increased to 20mg. Carvedilol was continued. Remained \\nnormotensive throughout rest of stay.\\n.\\n#Diarrhea: Pt had several episodes of loose stools on day prior \\nto discahrge. C. diff was checked and is pending.\\n . \\n#Unroofed Bulla on Dorsum of Right foot: No active signs of \\ninfection. Being managed by wound care. See below.\\n.                                                \\t___ is a 78 year old M presenting to the ED with INC LE EDEMA. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Medicine and then visited Emergency Department, Medicine/Cardiology, Medicine/Cardiology. Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Acute on chronic systolic heart failure, Intestinal infection due to Clostridium difficile, Urinary tract infection, site not specified, Infection and inflammatory reaction due to indwelling urinary catheter, Diabetes mellitus without mention of complication, type II or unspecified type, not stated as uncontrolled, Atrial fibrillation, Other and unspecified Escherichia coli [E. coli], Congestive heart failure, unspecified, Gout, unspecified, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with chronic kidney disease stage I through stage IV, or unspecified, Chronic kidney disease, Stage III (moderate), Esophageal reflux, Venous (peripheral) insufficiency, unspecified, Hypertrophy (benign) of prostate with urinary obstruction and other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), Retention of urine, unspecified, Coronary atherosclerosis of unspecified type of vessel, native or graft, Aortocoronary bypass status, Other specified disorders of skin, Urinary catheterization as the cause of abnormal reaction of patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at time of procedure, Hypopotassemia in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures:  in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications:\\n48852\\t48868\\t21774772\\tPRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION:\\n___ year old woman with recurrent UTIs, and multiple medical \\nissues including sick sinus syndrome and afib requiring \\npacemaker who presents with delirium  in setting of UTI.\\n\\nACTIVE ISSUES: \\n# Delirium - Patient with baseline demetia, typically oriented \\nto person. She presented with hypoactive delirium, thought to be \\na toxic-metabolic encephalopathy due to UTI. She was treated for \\nurinary tract infection as below, and her mental status returned \\nto its baseline. Notably,  she also had an opacity on CXR that \\ncould have been another infectious source, although she had no \\napparent respiratory complaints or difficulties. Also has \\nhistory of subdural hematoma and Afib not on coumadin, but CNS \\ncauses were not thought likely and head CT was deferred given \\nclinical improvement. \\n\\n# Urinary tract infection - Pt with history of recurrent UTIs \\nincluding ESBL E.coli and yeast most recently. Pyuria and leuk \\nand nitrate on UA on admission.  She received meropenem and \\nfluconazole in ED given this history, and meropenem was \\ncontinued on the floor through HD#3. Her urine culture returned \\nwith cephalosporin sensitive proteus. She was transitioned to \\nceftriaxone and then cefpodoxime and completed a 7 day course on \\n___  \\n\\n# Right lung opacity - CXR on admission showed a new right lung \\nopacity, no lateral film. Could be small pneumonia or nodule. \\nPatient was in no respiratory distress, satting 100% on room \\nair, no cough during exam, therefore PNA was thought unlikely. \\nRepeat CXR on ___ did not redemonstrate the opacity, as a new \\npleural effusion had developed in the setting of receiveing \\nIVF\\'s. Could represent pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion, \\nvolume overload given IVF\\'s, or other potentially concerning \\nprocesses. However, given the patient\\'s advanced dementia and \\nlack of pulmnoary symptoms, further diagnostic tests were \\ndeferred, although repeat CXR in ___ weeks may be prudent.   \\n\\n# Hypoglycemia - Patient hypoglycemic to 53 in ED improved with \\nd10. She had low fingersticks in the 60\\'s during her first \\nhospital night, and was placed on D51/2NS. When she awoke and \\nbegan eating, her fingersticks improved. \\n\\n# Hypothyroidism - Pt with history of hypothyroidism, per \\ndaughter thyroid labs were low in rehab so pt\\'s levothyroxine \\nwas increased to 100mcg daily. TSH 7.7 now. Free T4 was normal. \\nWe continued levothyroxine 100. Consider rechecking TSH in ___ \\nweeks.                                                \\t___ is a 91 year old F presenting to the ED with HYPOGLYCEMIA. Over the course of her hospital course, ___ started at Med/Surg and then visited Emergency Department. Over the course of their hospital stay, her was given the following diagnoses: Urinary tract infection, site not specified, Toxic encephalopathy, Other pancytopenia, Dementia, unspecified, without behavioral disturbance, Cardiac pacemaker in situ, Hypoglycemia, unspecified, Atrial fibrillation, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with chronic kidney disease stage I through stage IV, or unspecified, Chronic kidney disease, Stage III (moderate), Myelodysplastic syndrome, unspecified, Postsurgical hypothyroidism, Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field, Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and cerebral infarction without residual deficits, Osteoarthrosis, unspecified whether generalized or localized, site unspecified, Personal history of colonic polyps, Thoracic aneurysm without mention of rupture, Do not resuscitate status in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures: Artificial pacemaker rate check in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications:\\n49026\\t49042\\t21583948\\t___ year old male with a history of EtOh-cirrhosis, on transplant \\nlist, complicated by hepato-renal syndrome on HD, presenting \\nwith worsening abdominal pain and fatigue.\\n.\\n# Transition to Comfort Care: the patient\\'s TIPS was found to be \\nnot patent and the patient was not considered a transplant \\ncandidate in the near future. The family opted to focus on \\ncomfort. He was transitioned to CMO and passed away at 6:30 am \\non ___.\\n.\\n# Sepsis - Abdominal pain is present on review of systems; \\ndiagnostic paracentesis reveals a WBC count of >4000 with >90% \\npolys consistent with either SBP or secondary bacterial \\nperitonitis (given repeated taps), but no perforation or abscess \\nseen on CT abdomen.  Lipase and LFTs are within normal limits \\nmaking other abdominal sources unlikely.  Alkaline phosphatase \\nis elevated which could be secondary to TIPS.  There is concern \\nthat a clot in the TIPS could be infected. He was treated \\nempirically initially with vanc and zosyn, the vancomycin was \\nchanged to daptomycin for VRE given hx of VRE in peritoneal \\nfluid in ___ and chronic thrombocytopenia (so avoid linezolid). \\nThe fluid culture revealed GNRs. He did receive albumin for SBP \\ndespite already having HRS and being on HD. The fluid culture \\ngrew e.coli which was resistant to zosyn, which he had been \\ntreated with, and he was transitioned to ceftriaxone, which the \\ne.coli was sensitive to. \\n.\\n# Hypotension: blood pressure was in the range of SBP ___ at \\nnight; then increased during the day to the 100s. He was started \\non midodrine but was unable to take this secondary to his ileus, \\nwhich was causing him not to absorb PO medications. At time of \\ntransition to CMO, the patient\\'s blood pressure was 60/40.\\n.\\n# Ileus: the patient developed a severe ileus, which was thought \\nto be ___ his peritonitis and his ascites. An NGT was placed \\nwith relief of nausea and vomiting, and he was discharged with \\nthis tube to hospice for intermittent suctioning. At time of \\ndischarge, less than 500cc per day was being aspirated, which \\nwas mostly the food that he was eating for comfort. He did stool \\nvery small amounts even with lactulose.\\n.\\n# Anemia: the patient has had an acute hematocrit drop from 28 \\nto 21. The patient has baseline anemia, likely secondary to \\nkidney disease and liver disease; prior iron studies consistent \\nwith anemia of chronic disease. In the setting of acute \\nhematocrit drop, concern for bleed; no signs of acute bleeding \\ndespite history of varices. No signs of hemorrhage on CT abd.\\n.\\n# Cirrhosis - Secondary to EtOH.  He is no longer drinking.  \\nListed for transplant.  Complicated by esophageal varices, \\nhepatic encephalopathy, and refractory ascites s/p TIPS that is \\nno longer patent. Continued lactulose and rifaximin. On \\nprophylactic bactrim for SBP, which was held during his \\ntreatment of SBP. He did receive a therapeutic paracentesis with \\nremoval of 10L of fluid on ___. After that point, although he \\nwas in pain with his distension, the patient could not have \\nanother paracentesis as his hypotension was preventative. \\n.\\n# End stage renal disease - Hemodialysis for hepatorenal \\nsyndrome in setting of cirrhosis. The patient missed HD on day \\nof admission (___) so recieved an extra session on ___, \\nin which 1L was removed. Sevelamer and calcium acetate were \\ncontinued. \\n.\\n#IDDM - continue home lantus and sliding scale. \\n.  \\n#. Ventral Hernia: Per records this is not reducible but not \\nchanged from prior. No evidence of incarceration/strangulation. \\nThis has been one of the patient\\'s most significant sources of  \\ndiscomfort and embarassment for several years however he has \\nbeen told that he is not a candidate for surgical repair until \\nafter he has a liver transplant.  \\n.    \\n#. Hypothyroidism: Chronic. Continue Levothyroxine at home dose. \\n\\n. \\n# CONTACT: WIFE : ___ sister \\n___                                                \\t___ is a 63 year old M presenting to the ED with FEELING UNWELL.

She \\nwas found to have a recurrent left pleural effusion (suspected \\nmalignant as cytology previously had shown atypical cells). She \\nwas initially covered for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) \\nand diruesed with IV furosemide. The plan was to persue Pleurex \\nplacement, but pt became progessively delirious with altered \\nmental status during her hospital course. CT head ___ done for \\naggitation was negative. EEG ___ was concerning for seizure \\nactivity, so she was loaded with Dilantin. LP was done ___, and \\nempiric meningitis coverage (vanc, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, \\nampicillin) was started. P t continued to have seizure activity, \\nso Keppra was added ___. On ___, pt continued to have seizure \\nactivity on EEG, consistent with status epilepticus, so valproic \\nacid was started. MRI head was done which showed a 20 x 15 mm, \\ncompletely rim enhancing lesion with surrounding edema in the \\nleft frontal lobe, concerning for abscess or metastatic cancer. \\nUpon reviewing other previous head CTs, this lesion was present \\nin the left frontal lobe going back to ___ with \\nassociated edema, making metastatic lesion more likely.  \\n\\nAt approximately 11:45pm on ___, pt was found to be completely \\nunresponsive and pulseless and a Code Blue was called. Pt was \\nfound to be in PEA arrest. After approximately 12 minutes, she \\nhad spontaneous return of circulation. Upon review of the \\ncontinuous EEG she had running at the time, she was bradycardic \\nand with suppressed EEG activity for 30 minutes before \\ncirculation was restored.  She required vasopressin (later \\nchanged to norepinephrine) to support her blood pressure and was \\nintubated for lack of respiratory drive.  She was continued on \\nbroad spectrum antibiotics to cover possible brain abscess, \\naspiration pneumonia and HCAP, as well as VRE which had grown in \\nher urine.  However, she suffered shock liver, anuric renal \\nfailure, and severe anoxic brain injury as a result of the \\nprolonged time without a perfusing cardiac rhythm.  \\n\\nNeurology was consulted to assist with the anoxic brain injury \\nand they reviewed the various EEGs as well as brain MRI.  She \\ndid not have any brainstem reflexes on exam except occasional \\nspontaneous ventilation which was not enough to wean her off \\nfull ventilator dependency.  Neuro felt that her possibility of \\nrecovering normal cortical function was very low and that she \\nwas in a persistent vegetative state.  This was communicated to \\nthe family and eventually they decided to withdraw antibiotics \\nand antiepileptics.  She passed away within 24 hours of that \\ndecision despite continuing norepinephrine and mechanical \\nventilation. \\n\\nHer anuric renal failure was not responsive to IV fluid \\nresuscitation.  She continued to have rising creatinine and \\npotassium and developed metabolic acidosis from the renal \\nfailure.  Given her overall poor prognosis and impending brain \\ndeath, the ICU team felt that offering dialysis was medically \\nfutile.  She ultimately passed away likely from circulatory \\nfailure in the setting of acidosis.                                                \\t___ is a 81 year old F presenting to the ED with HYPOTENSION.

During the procedure, she required 7 \\nunits of PRBCs and 4 units of FFP.  Post-operatively her crit \\nwas found to be 38.9; she had a brief episode of hypotension to \\nthe ___ post-op but recovered and repeat crit was found to be \\n36.  \\n\\nOvernight into POD#1 she had three bloody maroon bowel movements \\nand persistent melena.  Her hematocrits, measured serially, \\ndrifted to 33, but she remained stable and was transferred to \\nthe VICU the following day.  There, repeat crits were stable in \\nthe low ___, and it was decided to advance her diet.  The \\nfollowing day, POD#3, she was considered safe to bear weight and \\ngot up with physical therapy; she became briefly orthostatic to \\nthe ___ but was entirely asymptomatic and recovered.  PO intake \\nwas encouraged and she got up again later and did well.  \\n\\nAlso on POD#3, ID was consulted and recommended not less than 6 \\nweeks of PO metronidazole and IV ceftriaxone.  These were \\ninitiated in the inpatient setting.  The patient received a \\nleft-sided PICC line to continue receiving IV antibiotics in the \\noutpatient setting.  On the same day, her foley came out and she \\nvoided.  \\n\\nShe tolerated a regular diet and her pain was well controlled on \\nPOD#4, she ambulated well with minimal assistance, and she was \\ndetermined to be safe for discharge to home with services.  She \\nwill continue to receive daily ceftriaxone infusion through her \\nPICC.  She will take daily aspirin for anticoagulation and oral \\nmetronidazole for infection prophylaxis.  She has follow-up \\narranged with ID and with vascular surgery.  She is discharged \\nto home on POD#4 with all appropriate information, warnings, \\nprescriptions, and follow-up.                                                \\t___ is a 79 year old F presenting to the ED with BRBPR, Transfer.

Report from ___ was \\nrequested but unavailable at the time of this discharge summary. \\nHas been seen by cardiology in the past (Dr. ___ ___ who \\ndescribed similar pain episodes, wich was not felt to be cardiac \\nin nature at that time. It is possible she could have developed \\nclincially significant coronary disease since prior work up, but \\ngiven the fact that she has had multiple stress tests, coronary \\ncaths, and four sets of troponins negative since this \\npresentation, other etiologies more likely. Hypertensive urgency \\ncould be causing demand ischemia, but would expect to see some \\ntroponins. Noncardiac causes such as GERD or reactive airway \\ndisease also possible, however no relief with antacids or \\nbronchodilators. CT angiogram of the chest was negative for \\npulmonary embolism.

HOSPITALIZATION:\\n\\n___ year old male with hx. sickle cell disease with frequent \\nadmission for sickle crisis presenting with c/o chest and arm \\npain. He was given IVF, increased pain medications, and \\nsupplemental O2. His pain improved and he was discharged home \\nwith followup appointments \\n\\nACUTE CARE\\n# Sickle crisis: patient presenting with chest and arm pain \\nconsistent with prior sickle crises. Has known AVN of shoulders \\nand hips. Multiple admissions in past year for similar. Unclear \\nprecipitant.  No signs of acute chest syndrome.  He was placed \\non maintenance IVF to maintain brisk urine output.  Pain \\ncontrolled with PO dilaudid 4mg Q3H.  Was also maintained on \\nhome methadone maintenance.  He was transitioned to an oral \\nregimen of oxycodone plus home methadone at discharge.  Also \\ncontinued on folate and hydroxyurea.  Was encouraged to keep \\nhematology appointment for followup of this chronic issue. \\n\\n# Diarrhea: endorsed 2d diarrhea, nonbloody, no recent abx \\nthough multiple recent hospitalizations could have been exposed \\nto c diffe.  Patient was notably without diarrhea here but did \\nhave c diff sent that was negative.\\n\\n#Chest pain: The patient had chest pain that was similar to \\nprior presentations. Troponin was measured at 0.07 and repeat \\nwas <0.01. No ECG changes and no changes on telemetry. Unclear \\nif cardiac ischemic event. In sickle cell anemia, \\npathophysiology of cardiac ischemia is of small vessel, rather \\nthan epicardial origin. He was given ASA nonetheless and \\nsupported with oxygen and IVF.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n# Asthma: continued albuterol, fluticasone  \\n\\n# GERD: continued omeprazole, avoided NSAIDs ie toradol given \\nrecent hx gastritis and ulcers (upper EGD in ___.)\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n- need to keep followup appointment with hematology\\n- further management of pain medications per PCP\\nFULL CODE                                                \\t___ is a 30 year old M presenting to the ED with CHEST PAIN.

\\nThis is a ___ with h/o HTN, AAA and newly diagnosed RA (with \\nrecent steroid injection to her finger) who presents with L hip \\nand leg pain.\\n\\nACTIVE ISSUES\\n#Left Hip and Leg Pain: The patient presented with severe left \\nhip and leg pain. Initial imaging in the ED was non-diagnostic \\nso she was admitted to the medicine service to rule out septic \\njoint. Given her lack of fever, leukocytosis, normal CRP and \\nonly mildly elevated ESR, the likelihood of septic joint was \\nfelt to be low. CT imaging showed a slight asymmetric \\nenlargement of the left iliopsoas and iliacus muscles compared \\nto the right and did not reveal any drainable fluid collecton. \\nGiven that her pain continued despite medication, an MRI without \\ncontrast was performed. This similarly showed iliacus and psoas \\nasymmetry and hyperintensity but also showed a focal area of \\ninhomogenous signal that could not be characterized without \\ncontrast. She then underwent MRI with contrast that showed two \\nsmall areas of rim enhancement that were most consistent with an \\nevolving hematoma.  Her pain was managed with standing tylenol, \\nlidocaine patches and low-dose oxycodone and baclofen as needed. \\nHer medications should be titrated while she is at rehab. If she \\ncontinues to have pain despite medications and physical therapy, \\nshe should have repeat imaging to confirm resolution of \\nhematoma.\\n\\n# Hypertension: She had blood pressures to the 170s on \\nadmission, with pain a likely contributor. Her home amlodipine \\n10mg was restarted with improvement in blood pressure to the \\n130s systolic. Her lisinopril was discontinued and could be \\nrestarted per her outpatient providers.\\n\\n# GERD: Pt has known h/o GERD and she was continued on her home \\nomeprazole.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n- Please titrate pain medications as necessary (discharged on \\nlidocaine patch, standing tylenol, oxycodone 2.5mg q4h prn pain \\nand baclofen 5mg TID x 3days. Please make sure to continue bowel \\nregimen while on pain medications\\n- If she continues to have pain without improvement would \\nrecommend followup imaging to confirm resolution of hematoma\\n- Her lisinopril was discontinued on admission. If she becomes \\nhypertensive, would consider restarting or starting HCTZ along \\nwith her amlodipine                                                \\t___ is a 88 year old F presenting to the ED with L Hip pain, Abd pain.

LFTs within normal limits. \\nDaughter ___ no history of liver disease. Consider \\noutpatient hepatology follow up.\\n\\n# Thombocytopenia: Likely in setting of cirrhosis, suspected \\nviral gastroenteritis. Repeat CBC as outpatient. \\n\\n# RESOLVED ___: Baseline creatinine 1.6-1.7. Secondary to \\nhypertensive emergency vs. prerenal in the setting of \\ndehydration. Renal US with minimally increased resistive indices \\nin the right kidney, no RAS. Returned to baseline with IVF. \\n\\n# RESOLVED Metabolic Acidosis: in the setting of renal \\ndysfunction and elevated lactate, concern for dehydration in \\nsetting of diarrhea and vomiting. Resolved on ___.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n[] PCP appointment ___ at 10:00am\\n[] Please recheck CBC at follow-up anemia/thrombocytopenia \\n(discharge Hb 12.4, Plt 121)\\n[] Patient was hypertensive to SBP 240\\'s while vomiting \\ninitially; spontaneously dropped to 150-160\\'s systolic; consider \\nadding antihypertensive as outpatient\\n[] Patient continued to have dysuria during admission, negative \\nUA, consider further workout outpatient\\n[] Consider outpatient work-up of possible cirrhosis based on \\nslightly nodular appearance of the liver noted on CT imaging\\n\\n# COMMUNICATION: Daughter, ___, ___                                                \\t___ is a 87 year old M presenting to the ED with n/v/d, GI bleed, Transfer. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Medicine and then visited Medicine, Emergency Department, Medicine. Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Hypertensive emergency, Acidosis, Unspecified cirrhosis of liver, Other secondary thrombocytopenia, Dehydration, Diaphragmatic hernia without obstruction or gangrene, Anemia, unspecified, Viral intestinal infection, unspecified, Esophagitis, unspecified, Blindness, both eyes, Personal history of peptic ulcer disease in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures:  in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications:\\n55141\\t55157\\t23717411\\t___ with hx of amyloid cardiomyopathy (EF 55%), permanent Afib \\non apixaban, severe TR and CKD who presents s/p mechanical fall \\nfound to have hyponatremia and ___.\\n\\n# Acute on chronic decompensated dCHF: EF 55% ___ senile amyloid \\ns/p EMB. Patient came in 7 pounds above dry weight of 135-138 \\npounds, elevated proBNP 5187.  He was admitted on bumex 4 mg BID \\nwith metolazone 2.5 mg every other ___ at home. TTE showed \\ndepressed EF 40-45%. Patient was diuresed with lasix gtt with \\nboluses. Patient was transitioned to PO torsemide initially BID, \\nhowever he was urinating at night which negatively affected his \\nquality of life and prior to discharge was transitioned to 80 mg \\nPO torsemide daily, 12.5 of spironolactone daily, and 2.5 mg of \\nmetolazone q week (___). Discharge weight 64 kg.\\n\\n# Hyponatremia: Patient presented asymptomatic with Na of 126 \\nfrom baseline mid ___. Volume status appeared hypervolemic. \\nEtiology most likely in setting of chronic dCHF with decreased \\neffective intravascular volume leading to appropriate ADH \\nresponse with UNa < 10. Patient was placed on free water \\nrestriction and diuresed as above. Discharge Na 133.\\n\\n# R pleural effusion: Patient has a chronic R pleural effusion. \\nPer patient, has been drained before at OSH (about a year ago). \\nPatient has DOE at baseline per his report, but oxygen \\nsaturations remained stable on room air. Patient had therapeutic \\nthoracentesis by IP on ___ draining 2L serous fluid with \\nchemistries suggesting transudative fluid, preliminary fluid \\ncytology negative for malignancy, fluid appeared bland. Possibly \\nsecondary to heart failure, though would expect to see \\nunilateral effusion. Subsequent XXR revealed re-accumulation of \\nthe pleural effusion without a change in his respiratory \\nsymptoms, unlikely re-expansion effusion as pleural pressures \\nbecame low during procedure and only 2L removed. At the time of \\ndischarge it was felt that the patient\\'s respiratory symptoms \\nwere stable and there was no indication for urgent repeat \\nthoracentesis. If his symptoms of dyspnea increase he may \\nbenefit from pleural drain placement by Interventional \\nPulmonology.

Urticaria:\\nMr. ___ had acute onset of oral and lingual \\nangioedema on ___ that was preceded by 2 weeks of urticaria \\nthat did not respond to cetirizine or prednisone. He required \\nnasal intubation and mechanical ventilation x48 hours. He \\nreceived high dose steroids and antihistamines with subsequent \\nimprovement of his angioedema, permitting extubation. The \\ntrigger was unknown. He had not been on an ___, NSAIDs, or \\nantibiotics. He denies prior anaphylaxis or urticaria with any \\nfoods or nuts. His milk-thistle and fishoil were held based on \\nrecommendations from allergy consultants. H pylori antibody was \\ntested given some association between H pylori infection and \\nangioedema. The antibody was positive, but stool antigen was \\nunable to be collected. C1-esterase activity was normal. \\nTryptase was pending at discharge. On the two days prior to \\ndischarge he had some mild recrudescence of his urticaria on his \\nback and right arm, but pruritus was minimal and there was no \\nangioedema. We speculated that being on vancomycin, which \\ntriggers mast cell degranulation, may have caused transient \\nworsening of already sensitized dermal mast cells. Vancomycin \\nwas stopped and he was discharged with cetirizine and an \\nepinephrine pen in the event that he has lingual angioedema \\nagain. He was no longer on prednisone at the time of discharge. \\nHe had allergy clinic follow up at discharge. \\n\\n#Possible bacterial pneumonia: He developed a leukocytosis and \\nfevers in the ICU. A sputum culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae \\nand methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus. He had faint \\ncrackles at his right base and somewhat equivocal evidence of \\npneumonia on his chest Xray. However, given that he was briefly \\nintubated for ~48 hours he was treated with antibiotics. He \\ninitially had piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin for ~48 \\nhrs. He was then switched to Bactrim DS 2 tabs BID x9 days at \\ndischarge. He had instructions to return to the hospital if he \\nhad worsening respiratory symptoms.                                                \\t___ is a 47 year old M presenting to the ED with Allergic reaction.

After \\nreview of the CTA we felt that the right subclavian artery had \\nfocal stenosis or partial thrombosis of the subclavian artery \\njust distal to the stent but the stent was patent. There was \\ngood distal flow to the axillary artery which also had \\nmultifocal stenoses.   There is also evidence of high-grade \\nstenosis of the proximal right vertebral artery. \\n\\nDigit pressures and waveforms were excellent. Her antiplatelet \\nwas changed to plavix from aspirin.

She also was noted to have focal motor seizures \\ncharacterized by left facial twitching, with or without left \\neye/head deviation, tonic contraction of left arm, with no loss \\nof awareness.  \\n\\n#Left Occipital Stroke: For workup of her symptoms, she was \\nfound to have a new left occipital infarct. The etiology for \\nthis stroke is likely cardioembolic given known history of \\natrial fibrillation and prior strokes. It was difficult to \\nassess if she had any new symptoms from this stroke. In \\nparticular a left occipital stroke would classically cause a \\nright homonymous hemianopia, but this was difficult to assess \\ngiven that she had right eye blindness at baseline and was a \\npoor historian. She remained in atrial fibrillation on \\ntelemetry. Stroke risk factors included hemoglobin A1c 5.5, LDL \\n29, and TSH 0.97. MRI brain w/o contrast was deferred given \\nclear etiology for recurrent seizure, frailty and hyperactive \\ndelirium. She was evaluated by ___ and recommended for discharge \\nhome with 24 hour supervision. This was discussed at length with \\nfamily who voiced understanding. She was continued on Warfarin \\nfor goal INR ___.  \\n\\n#Seizures: The most likely etiology for her seizures, on the \\nother hand, is more likely related to prior right frontoparietal \\ninfarctions given  left sided motor activity. Given that her old \\ninfarct is continuing to act as a seizure focus, she was started \\non anti epileptic therapy. Unfortunately, Keppra seemed to \\nworsen her mental status. As a result, she was transitioned to \\nlacosamide 100mg BID and taken off of the Keppra. She was \\nmonitored for 24 hours on lacosamide without seizures and \\ntolerated it well, without significant sedation or further \\nseizures. Her mental status improved as well to her baseline.\\n\\n#Hyperactive delirium: Her hospital course was otherwise notable \\nfor hyperactive delirium, for which she did require small \\namounts of zyprexa as needed. This was likely due to \\nhospital-acquired delirium in setting of elderly age, multiple \\nmedical comorbidities, with possible contribution from new \\nstroke and lacosamide.  Infectious workup did include a \\nrelatively benign UA (WBC 4, RBC 1, few bacteria) which was not \\ntreated given that she improved in terms of her mental status. \\n\\n#Bradycardia: Patient was noted to have intermittent bradycardia \\nto ___ during hospitalization, often with HRs running in \\n___. Her home metoprolol was held given its AV nodal \\neffects.  This can be re-assessed as an outpatient.                                                \\t___ is a 86 year old F presenting to the ED with Slurred speech.

Differential was broad and concerning for \\nmalingering vs inflammatory bowel disease vs infection.  CT \\ndemonstrated no etiology.  The patient was afebrile and without \\nleukocytosis, making infection less likely.  Additionally, her \\ninfectious workup of her abdominal pain was negative.  Her ESR \\nand CRP were normal, which was not suggestive of inflammatory \\nbowel disease flare.  Also, would not expect nausea and vomiting \\nwith UC. She had a recent admission to ___ for similar GI \\ncomplaints where she refused GI evaluation.  During her \\nadmission, there was concern for drug-seeking behavior.  Her EGD \\ndemonstrated gastritis and evidence of celiac disease, \\nconsistent with a elevated TTG.  Her colonoscopy was grossly \\nnormal but pathology demonstrated lymphocyic colitis, which was \\nfelt by GI to be consistent with loose stools but not abdominal \\npain.  She complained of additional abdominal pain after the \\ncolonoscopy.  No free air was observed under he diaghragm to \\nsuggest perforation.  She was treated symptomatically while \\nadmitted with tylenol and heat packs.  She was also continued on \\nher omeprazole, which was increased to 40 BID given her \\ngastritis on EGD.  She will be started on budesonide 9mg for 6 \\nweeks for management of her colitis with follow-up in GI clinic \\nin 3 weeks. \\n\\n# substance abuse history: OMR notes from ___ outline \\ntreatment plans for this patient. It is emphasized to use no \\nnarcotics; only prescribe benzos or tramadol if medically \\nindicated. During admission, pt was somnolent at times and \\nslurring speech. She requested diazepam which was not given.  \\nAdditionally, there was one instance during the hospitalization \\nwhere it was thought that the patient went outside to use drugs. \\n Her respiratory rate was diminished upon return to the floor. \\nHer vitals however were stable and her respiratory rate returned \\nto baseline without intervention.  It is also thought that she \\nwas withdrawing from opiates.  She reported crampy abdominal \\npain and was observed to have dilated pupils.  This has been \\nmanaged with clonidine which is now being discontinued on \\ndischarge.  \\n\\n# psychiatric history: extent of history is unclear, and she has \\nseen psychiatry who believes that she suffers from a component \\nof PTSD without evidence of mood disturbance.  She was continued \\non her buspar, venlafaxine, and clonazepam.  She denied SI/HI \\nduring her stay, but then claimed SI when she found that she \\nwould be discharged.  After psych re-evaluation, she was \\ndischarged to ___ for further psychiatric \\nmanagement.\\n\\n# Celiac disease: She has apparently not been adherent to her \\ngluten free diet, as evidenced by her elevated TTG.  She was \\ncounseled regarding her diet by nutrition.\\n.\\nTransitional\\n# f/u with gastroenterology for management and biopsy results\\n# f/u with new primary care physician                                                \\t___ is a 47 year old F presenting to the ED with ABD PAIN.

Upon testing this \\nadmission, his HIV viral load was positive but his antibody was \\nnegative. His CD4 count was 378. He was started on Truvada and \\nDolutegravir on ___. His fevers persisted but down trended \\ntoward the end of his admission. His diarrhea was likely \\nsecondary to HIV but improved over admission. Microsporidium, \\ncampylobacter, O and P, cyclosporidium, and giardia were \\nnegative. C diff was also negative. He had a +NG rectal test and \\na -CT rectal test so was given Ceftriaxone 250 mg IV once ___ \\nand Azithromycin 1000 mg PO/NG once ___. Patient\\'s headache and \\nsore throat also improved over his hospital course. He was \\nworried about losing weight on therapy so ensure shakes were \\nadded to his diet three times/day. He also developed lymphopenia \\nand thrombocytopenia likely secondary to acute HIV. His lipid \\npanel was normal with slightly lower HDL (38). Quantiferon gold \\nwas negative as were his blood cultures, urine culture, urine \\nCT/NG, Toxoplasma IgG, VZV, CMV IgG/IgM, RPR, HbsAg, HBsAb, \\nHBcAB, HAV ab, and HCV. He will follow up with ___.\\n\\n#Anal pain:\\nPatient with pain and small amount of blood on the toilet paper \\nwith bowel movements. Likely multifactorial with acute rectal N. \\ngonorrhea infxn and anal fissures. We treated him with \\nantibiotics as above, and gave stool softeners, and witch ___.\\n\\n#Hematemesis:\\nSmall amount of bright red blood post swallowing ibuprofen on \\n___. GI consulted given HIV status and recommended \\nconservative management with PPI and trending his H and H. The \\npatient did not have any further hematemesis, and it was felt \\nthat it could possibly have been a red-colored beverage present \\nin the room.\\n\\n#Pancytopenia:\\nPatient with all three cell lines decreased. Initially some \\nconcern for TTP, but labs were not indicative of hemolysis and \\nno schistocytes were seen on blood smear. Therefore, \\npancytopenia likely secondary to HIV infection. Haptoglobin was \\nhigh but likely in the setting of HIV infection as well.\\n\\n#Social Situation:\\nPatient did not want to tell family members about current \\nmedical situation, but did call father and let him know of \\ndiagnosis. He has a tenuous support system. Social work was \\nconsulted and is working on setting him up with a therapist. He \\nhas arranged to tell his aunt and live with his aunt after \\ndischarge.\\n\\n#Withdrawn affect:\\nWithdrawn and sometimes nodding off during exam. Social work was \\nconsulted and was working on arranging therapy. Patient was \\nstill hesitant about therapy. This should be continued to be \\nevaluated as an outpatient.\\n\\n#Nipple discomfort:\\nPatient was worried that his nipple piercings were infected \\nalthough there was no erythema, drainage, or warmth. Patient \\nendorses pain and usually treats this at home with warm \\nwater/non-iodized salt.

Also has patchy deficits in pinprick and cold \\nsensation in the lower extremities that follow a vague distal to \\nproximal gradient. He is areflexic nearly everywhere except for \\nhis right biceps (1+) and bilateral achilles. His gait is slow \\nand slightly wide-based, and is unsteady on Romberg testing.  \\n(He was assessed by ___ who recommended home with ___\\n\\nDuring his admission, MR brain and spine showed multiple \\nperiventricular white matter lesions and spinal cord lesions \\nconsistent with demyelinating lesions of MS.  ___ \\nrecent LP in ___ (for another episode of sensory symptoms) \\nshowed 11 oligoclonal bands in the serum.  These findings of \\nsensory symptoms and radiologic lesions separated in time and \\nspace are consistent with a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.  \\nThere is also the possibility of NMO given that he is ___ \\n___ and the extensive nature of his spinal cord lesion; \\nthus aquaporin 4 was sent off and was pending on discharge. \\n\\nThis diagnosis was discussed with the patient and he was \\nadministered one dose of Solumedrol 1gm IV. We discussed the \\nplan for at least one more IV solumedrol administration tomorrow \\nprior to his discharge and formulation of an outpatient infusion \\nplan.  Mr. ___ was able to voice that he understood the risks \\nand benefits of staying in the hospital to pursue further \\nSolumedrol under close nursing supervision. Eventually, he did \\nleave against medical advice.

UA and UCx were negative. His CXR was notable for \\ncongestion and streaky opacities which could indicate an \\ninfection. In the setting of a few weeks of cough, patient was \\nstarted on HCAP coverage with vanc/cefepime/azithro since he has \\nhad two recent hospitalizations for a similar complaint. \\nPreliminary blood culture showed gram positive rods and cocci, \\nwith indication of contamination and negative surveillance \\ncultures on discharge. HCAP was the most likely source of fever. \\nPatient was afebrile during hospitalization and his \\nleuckocytosis resolved, but patient had waxing and wanning \\nconfusion. Patient completed appropriate treatment for HCAP with \\nvancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. In the setting of \\nresolving fever and leuckocytosis, and confusion that started a \\nfew months ago, an underlyning cognitive condition, including \\ndementia or depression might contribute to the altered mental \\nstatus. There were no findings suggesting an acute neurological \\ncause of his AMS. Uremia was also a consideration given his \\nelevated BUN in the setting of CKD, but renal felt the \\ntimecourse of his symptoms did not fit this diagnosis.  \\n \\n# CKD: Patient has ESRD, with placement of an AV fistula in \\n___. Per his nephrologist\\'s notes, patient is in the process \\nof starting dialysis soon. At presentation, BUN and Cr were \\nsimilar to his recent baseline, and had metabolic acidosis with \\nanion gap unchanged from basline. He made adequate urine output \\nduring his hospitalization. As planned, patient will benefit \\nfrom initiation of hemodialysis in the recent future. He is \\nscheduled for renal follow up after discharge. \\n \\n# Aphasia: Patient complains of occasional anomia and \\nparaphasia. A recent head CT on ___ showed no acute \\nintracranial process. His neurological exam was normal. Based on \\nthese findings, there does not seem to be an acute process \\ncausing the occasional aphasia. An outpatient neurology \\nfollow-up might be needed if the aphasia persists.                                                \\t___ is a 71 year old M presenting to the ED with MENTAL STATUS CHANGES.

His exam was \\nconcerning for a dense\\nright MCA infarct. Repeat head CT in our ED showed the right MCA \\ninfarct. CTA revealed a right M2 superior division cutoff. Even \\nwith the assumption that he was last well seen at 6:30 am as he \\nreports he had no trouble then (which is not reliable due to \\npresence of neglect), he was not an IV tpa candidate due to an \\nelevated INR. Given the infarct progression and finding on his \\nhead CT, he was\\nalso not a candidate for IA intervention as the risks outweighed \\nthe benefits.  Most likely, infarct was embolic in setting of \\nafib despite appropriate INR. \\n.\\nMr. ___ was initially admitted to the neurology ICU because \\nhis systolic blood pressures were in the low 100s and it was \\nthought he may need vasopressors to attain adequate cerebral \\nperfusion. However, once A-line was placed, saw that MAPs were \\n~100, so patient never requited pressors. His coumadin was \\nstopped because embolic stroke despite being on coumadin for \\nafib indicated coumadin failure. In ICU he underwent stroke risk \\nfactor workup including TTE (showed no PFO/ASD), full lipid \\npanel (showed LDL 66) and A1C (mildly elevated to 6.4%). \\n.\\nOn HD #3, patient was transferred from ICU to floor. MRI was \\nperformed, confirming presence of right MCA infarct. Of note, \\nthe MRI also showed some hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke, \\nbut regardless it was decided to continue anticoagulating \\npatient as his neuro exam was stable. Repeat head CT on day of \\ndischarge showed no increase in hemorrhage. Once his INR drifted \\nbelow 2, he was started on therapeutic Lovenox 70mg SC BID. Plan \\nis for him to stay on Lovenox until INR <1.5, and then switch to \\nPradaxa 150mg BID. INR on day of discharge was 1.7. His home \\ncilostazole should also be continued, as patient has CAD and \\nrequires anti-platelet therapy. He was also started on \\nFluoxetine, which has been shown to help with motor recovery \\nafter cortical strokes. \\n.\\nOn discharge, neuro exam was stable to mildly improved from \\nadmission: patient AAOx3 with abullic affect, and dense left \\nface/arm/leg hemiplegia. He is able to briefly wiggle his toes \\nat times. Per ___ recs, he was discharged to an acute rehab \\nfacility. He continues to require a dysphagia diet on discharge. \\nHe will follow up with Dr. ___ in outpatient neurology clinic \\nin 2 months. \\n.\\n# CV: patient\\'s home propranolol 120mg PO daily (for essential \\ntremor) was temporarily decreased to ___ dose during \\nhospitalization due to need to maintain adequate cerebral \\nperfusion pressure after stroke. Restarted on home dose at \\ndischarge. \\n.\\n=====================                                                \\t___ is a 82 year old M presenting to the ED with STROKE.

Since \\nthis time she reported various symptoms of hallucinations in her \\nright upper outer visual field (pin wheels, outlines of people, \\nvarious colors). On exam initially she had a right superior \\nquadrantanopia. Her neurologic exam was otherwise normal. MRI w/ \\nand w/o contrast showed T1 hyperintense partially enhancing \\nlesion with restricted diffusion and blooming artifact on GRE. \\nThe lesion was discussed with neuroradiology and ___ \\nand was felt to possibly represent cavernoma vs. less likely \\ntumor (i.e. hemorrhagic tumor such as metastasis). Tumor was \\nfelt less likely given minimal edema. She had CT Torso which \\nshowed 4 cm left adnexal cyst for which ultrasound was obtained \\nwhich revealed possible hemorrhagic cyst. In terms of her visual \\nsymptoms, she had 60 minute EEG which did not show seizures or \\ndischarges; however, her lesion is deeper and discharges or \\nseizures may not be apparent on EEG. Therefore, Keppra 500 mg \\nBID was started and increased to 750 mg bid given some \\nbreakthrough visual hallucinations. Her lisinopril was increased \\nto 10 mg daily given hypertension.

She received 4 minutes \\nof CPR followed by ROSC, and was transferred to the ICU \\nintubated and sedated. She did quite well over the next ___ \\nhours, was able to be extubated and transferred to the floor on \\n___.  At this\\npoint, her examination is notable for mild left upper extremity \\nweakness (pronation), otherwise nonfocal, with chest pain in \\nsetting of rib fractures. \\n\\nDifferential for stroke etiology favors cardioembolic (no \\nsignificant atherosclerotic disease, TTE revealed ___ \\n___ versus artery-to-artery embolus.   \\n\\n#Acute R M1 cutoff, s/p clot retrieval: Patient underwent tpa at \\n1:10PM on ___ at OSH and was transferred here for thrombectomy, \\nwhich was underwent with MCA recanalization after two passes \\n___. CTA at ___ indicated that the right MCA stem remained \\noccluded after the iv tPA. Clot retrieval commenced at 2:45PM \\nwith MCA recanalization at 3:09PM after two passes. \\nUnfortunately, ACA was noted to be closed at this time. There \\nwas also significant vasospasm in the R ICA, requiring treatment \\nwith multiple rounds of IA verapamil and nitro. At 3:30PM, Ms. \\n___ was noted to have a GTC and was given Ativan. She was \\nsubsequently intubated. Ms. ___ then coded at ~3:30 and CPR \\nwas initiated. She had ROSC within 4 min.  Post-procedure CTA, \\ndocuments patency of R MCA and ACA with no obvious frank \\nhemorrhage, but increased signal in a small paraventricular \\nregion, which could represent hemorrhagic\\ntransformation vs contrast extravasation or both. There is also \\nsevere narrowing of the R ICA, presumably due to vasospasm, \\nthough mural thrombus or dissection cannot be excluded.\\n\\nPost-operatively, her neurologic exam significantly improved, \\nnotable only for mild left arm weakness (pronation without \\ndrift) and right tricep weakness that was pain limited. She \\nunderwent noncontrast head CT repeat imaging 24 hours post \\noperatively which was stable, with no evidence of bleeding.\\n\\nFor stroke workup, stroke risk factors included LDL 101 for \\nwhich she was started on atorvastatin 40mg daily, and hemoglobin \\nA1c 4.7. Aspirin 81mg daily started for risk reduction. MRI head \\nrevealed acute to early subacute infarctions in the distribution \\nof the right middle cerebral artery and left posterior inferior \\ncerebellar artery, with associated intracranial hemorrhage \\nwithin right caudate and putamen. Repeat CTA on day of discharge \\nrevealed no overt evidence of vasospasm but rather some \\nirregularity of the R ICA, for which no changes to plan would \\nneed to be made at this time. \\n\\n#Rib Fracture: Patient had small rib fractures in setting of \\nreceiving CPR for chest compressions following PEA arrest. Chest \\npain was an ongoing issue. It was well controlled with Tylenol \\n1g TID, Oxycodone 5mg q4h PRN, and lidocaine patch. \\n\\n#PEA arrest: As stated above, she developed this \\npost-operatively in the setting of seizure, subsequent \\nbradycardia and apnea. Troponins were cycled and were negative \\nx2. EKG did not reveal any acute changes. TTE negative for PFO, \\nLV thrombus ___. Triglycerides 185. She did not have \\nany further abnormalities on telemetry. This was overall \\nconsidered to be a provoked event in the setting of the factors \\nabove, with seizure, bradycardia, vasospasm and apnea. \\n\\n#Respiratory insufficiency: She arrived to ICU intubated for \\nprocedure. She was successfully extubated on the morning of \\n___. She is saturating well on room air. She had intermittent \\nwheezing due to post-extubation changes, versus mild COPD\\nexacerbation in setting of stroke. Oxygen was weaned for goal O2 \\n90% in setting of COPD. She was placed on duonebs q6h standing \\nwith albuterol neb q2h PRN with improvement.

She also has poorly \\ncontrolled BPs since she is unable to swallow her pills. \\n\\n# Food impaction/odynophagia/esophagitis: Pt was seen by GI and \\ntaken to the endoscopy suite. EGD revealed esophageal food \\nimpaction, esophageal stricture, and esophagitis. Food impaction \\nwas removed, and she was maintained on a liquid diet. She was \\nstarted on a PPI for her esophagitis. She will need to follow-up \\nwith repeat EGD in 1 week for stricture dilation.\\n\\n# Hypertension: Initially attributed to recent inability to \\ntolerate PO intake and take her home meds. While NPO, severe \\nhypertension was treated with IV metoprolol and IV hydralazine. \\nOnce home meds were resumed, the patient had persistent \\nhypertension. Home BP meds were increased, however, due to \\nhypotensive episode (below), these were held.  Ultimately her \\nhome medications were continued without change on discharge.  \\nPlease follow up blood pressure closely and adjust as necessary.\\n\\n# Hypotension: On ___, she developed acute hypotension after a \\nlarge bowel movement.

I suspect this event was related to a \\nvagal response from her BM, plus her increased antihypertensive \\nregimen (Lisinopril and HCTZ were increased that morning).\\n\\n# Troponin Leak: ECG without changes. Attributed to severe \\nhypertension / demand in the setting of chronic kidney disease. \\nPt never had any chest pain or chest pressure.  Improved during \\nhospitalization.\\n\\n# RLQ Pain: Attributed to constipation. Pt was treated with \\naggressive bowel regimen.                                                \\t___ is a 91 year old F presenting to the ED with FB IN ESOPHAGUS.

Per discussion with her ___ providers, she has had \\nextensive workup for her falls in the past including tilt-table \\ntesting, EEG, multiple Loop monitor placements, with no clear \\netiology found. \\n\\n# NEURO: Patient was admitted to General Neurology service for \\nworkup of her falls. She underwent extensive workup for \\nneurologic/cardiac causes of falls including MRI (showed chronic \\nsmall vessel disease, no strokes/masses/other potential seizure \\nfoci), routine EEG (showed encephalopathy, otherwise negative), \\nand interrogation of her Loop monitor (showed brief run of SVT, \\nsee below for details). Further discussion with patient, family \\nand PCP revealed that she takes high doses of MS contin for \\nchronic pain and is often somnolent throughout the day, which is \\nlikely a primary contributor to her fall risk. During \\nhospitalization her MS contin regimen was tapered significantly, \\nand her home alprazolam and cyclobenzaprine were discontinued. \\nHer mental status and gait significantly improved. As her fall \\nrisk is also increased by deconditioning from chronic illness, \\nshe was evaluated by ___ who recommended discharge to rehab. No \\nneurology follow-up required as outpatient. \\n\\n# ORTHO: \\n\\n(1) LYTIC SKULL/HUMERUS LESIONS: ___ on admission showed \\nmultiple lytic skull lesions, documented on several prior \\nstudies from ___. Follow-up skeletal survey \\nalso showed ?lytic lesion in left humerus. This raised concern \\nfor multiple myeloma, but SPEP was negative (showed normal IgM, \\nlow IgA and IgG), UPEP negative, and no ___ proteins in \\nurine. Beta-2 microglobulin and kappa/lambda light chains \\npending on discharge. Per Heme-Onc consult, potential etiology \\nis Langerhans Histiocytosis. Will follow up with ___ Heme-Onc \\nas outpatient for further investigation. \\n\\n(2) LEFT ROTATOR CUFF TEAR: Patient found to have left rotator \\ncuff tear. Evaluated by Ortho who were concerned for underlying \\npathologic humerus lesion ___ either neoplasm or osteoporosis) \\nand recommended shoulder MRI which showed the aforementioned \\n?lytic humerus lesion. She will follow up with Ortho in two \\nweeks for further consideration of whether lesion should be \\nbiopsied as an outpatient. For treatment of her rotator cuff \\ntear, she received soft sling. ___ perform range of motion \\nexercises as tolerated at rehab. \\n\\n# ENDO: \\n\\n(1) VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY: Patient found to be severely vitamin D \\ndeficient (25OH D = 10) with elevated PTH, likely secondary \\nhyperparathyroidism from vit D deficiency. Etiology of the \\ndeficiency likely poor intake/sun exposure and poor GI \\nabsorption ___ recurrent pancreatitis. She has overall very poor \\nbone health and likely has osteoporosis, esp in setting of \\nchronic steroid use. Vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly (___) was \\nstarted. Will likely continue for ___ months as outpatient, then \\ntaper to 800 IU daily. Also started calcium carbonate 500mg TID. \\n\\n\\n# HEME: Blood smear (ordered by Heme-Onc due to concern for \\nmultiple myeloma, per above) showed no Rouleaux formations but \\ndid show some abnormal cells concerning for blasts. While \\nsuspicion for leukemia/lymphoma is low, it remains on \\ndifferential, so per recs serum Flow Cytometry was sent and will \\nbe followed up at outpt Heme-Onc appointment. \\n\\n# CARDIAC: Patient\\'s Loop monitor was interrogated by Cardiology \\n(EP) during hospitalization. It showed one brief run of \\ntachycardia two weeks ago, most likely SVT but cannot completely \\nrule out VT. Duration was too brief to cause a syncopal episode. \\nShe should follow up with Cardiology as outpatient to discuss \\npotential EP study for inducible VT (to be arranged by PCP). \\n\\n# RHEUM: for patient\\'s ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic \\narthritis, home prednisone 5mg daily was continued.    \\n\\n====================                                                \\t___ is a 54 year old F presenting to the ED with R/O STROKE.

\\nunder Dr. ___ for further work up and management of her \\nacute injuries following her fall from wheelchair. Initial \\ntrauma survey and imaging identified a left clavicular fracture, \\nan isolated right L1 transverse process fracture, and a \\ndisplaced right distal first metacarpal fracture. The Spine \\nServe was consulted for L1 transverse process fracture and \\ndetermined that she did not require operative management or \\nbrace and thus had no weight bearing restrictions. Her L \\nclavicular fracture was reviewed by Orthopedic Surgery and it \\nwas recommended that she keep her L arm in a sling at all times \\nwith mild ROM exercises to be performed daily. Her initial CT \\nC-Spine was negative for any acute fracture/injury, though the \\npatient continued to endorse point c-spine spinous process \\ntenderness. A follow up MRI was obtained which was negative for \\nany ligamentous injuries and her C-collar was subsequently \\nremoved at the request of the Spine Service. Her R first \\nmetacarpal fracture was evaluated by the Hand Service who deemed \\nher injury operative and she was thus brought to the Operating \\nRoom by Dr. ___ fixation and cast placement (for further \\ndetails regarding the procedure, please refer to the operative \\nreport). A tertiary trauma survey was later performed which was \\nnegative for any additional injuries.\\n\\nThroughout her hospitalization, she continued to complain of \\nsevere pain and various neurologic symptoms, such as L arm \\nparalysis and R eye blindness. She was further evaluated by \\nOrthopedic Surgery out of concern for possible brachial plexus \\ninjury in the setting of known clavicle fracture - however, she \\ncontinued to have a very inconsistent and unreliable exam and \\nwas observed using her L arm adequately when unaware of being \\nobserved, thus the decision was made to forego further imaging. \\nHer R eye blindness was evaluated by Ophthalmology who also \\nfound no organic basis for her complaints and deemed her \\neyesight normal.\\n\\nGiven her schizoaffective disorder and her constant demands for \\nIV narcotic pain medication in the setting of known prior opioid \\nabuse, Psychiatry was consulted and believed her to be \\ndeveloping onset of mania. Her psychiatric medications were \\nadjusted accordingly and she was deemed safe for discharge home \\non the morning of discharge. She was evaluated by ___ and OT, who \\nrecommended home with ___ and ___ services.\\n\\nOn the morning of HD6, the patient was tolerating a regular \\ndiet, voiding and mobilizing with assistance, her pain was \\nappropriately controlled with strict PO medications (Tylenol, \\ntramadol), her injuries were continuing to healing \\nappropriately, and she remained afebrile and hemodynamically \\nstable. She was thus deemed ready for discharge home with ___ \\nwith appropriate follow up appointments scheduled.                                                \\t___ is a 52 year old F presenting to the ED with Body pain, s/p Fall, Shoulder pain. Over the course of her hospital course, ___ started at Med/Surg/Trauma and then visited Med/Surg/Trauma, Emergency Department. Over the course of their hospital stay, her was given the following diagnoses: Unspecified fracture of first metacarpal bone, right hand, initial encounter for closed fracture, Unspecified fracture of first lumbar vertebra, initial encounter for closed fracture, Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications, Anemia, unspecified, Essential (primary) hypertension, Vitamin D deficiency, unspecified, Fall from non-moving wheelchair, initial encounter, Unspecified place in unspecified non-institutional (private) residence as the place of occurrence of the external cause, Dependence on wheelchair, Displaced fracture of shaft of left clavicle, initial encounter for closed fracture, Schizoaffective disorder, unspecified, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified, Hypothyroidism, unspecified, Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated, Hyperlipidemia, unspecified, Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis, Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, Personal history of pulmonary embolism, Personal history of other venous thrombosis and embolism, Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture, Obesity, unspecified, Body mass index (BMI) 28.0-28.9,

concern for BK virus and EBV\\nviremia. He presented after several days of ___ symptoms \\nand hematuria. An infectious workup revealed he had significant \\nhemorrhagic cystitis from BK virus and EBV viremia. He was \\ntreated with four cycles of IVIG and three cycles of Rituximab \\nwith significant improvement in his symptoms. \\n\\nACUTE ISSUES\\n===================\\n#EBV viremia: \\nMr. ___ presented with ___ symptoms for several days. On \\nadmission he was noted to have an elevated EBV viral load of \\n___ which had been obtained when he was in the ___ clinic \\nearlier in the week. He was given three cycles of Rituximab- \\n___, and ___. He also received four cycles of IVIG on \\n___ and ___ and ___. His EBV viral load peaked at \\n___ and trended downward to ___ as his symptoms improved. \\nA PET scan demonstrated diffuse FDG avid LAD consistent with EBV \\nviremia, as well as new ground glass opacities. At this time, \\nthe patient developed worsening respiratory status requiring up \\nto 6L of supplemental O2 at rest. A chest CT showed \\nconsolidations consistent with a viral pneumonia. Given unclear \\netiology initially of symptoms he was started on broad spectrum \\nantibiotics all of which were discontinued (cefepime \\n(___), flagyl (___) and vancomycin \\n(___). ID was consulted, and further infectious workup \\nwas pursued including testing for Flu-PCR, HHV6, CMV, \\nhistoplasma, mycoplasma legionella and a respiratory viral panel \\nall of which became negative. In light of the negative \\ninfectious workup and improvement in clinical status with \\ndowntrending EBV viral load, the ___ symptoms as well as \\nthe hypoxic respiratory failure were attributed to EBV viremia. \\nOf note, the patient did have an elevated B-D-glucan level, but \\nthis was after administration of IVIG thought to cause a false \\npositive. \\n\\n#Hemorrhagic Cystitis\\nOn presentation, the patient reported 2 days of gross hematuria. \\nHis BK viral load was elevated to ___ in the urine. He \\nalso presented with ___ (Cr elevated to 1.4 from baseline of \\n0.9. Renal ultrasound did not show evidence of obstruction. He \\nwas started on maintenance fluids in the setting of decreased PO \\nintake and treated with four cycles of IVIG on ___ and \\n___ and ___. Hematuria and ___ resolved on discharge. \\n\\n#Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:\\n#Severe Sepsis with pulmonary source: \\nDuring hospitaliazation, his respiratory status dcompensated and \\nfor several days he required 6L. He triggered for tachypnea on \\n___ and was evaluated by the FICU given concern for hypoxic \\nrespiratory failure. He improved with IV diuresis and subsequent \\nRituximab treatment. On exam patient was noted to have diffuse \\nwheezing and CT chest demonstrated a viral pneumonia. He was \\nplaced on standing duoneb treatments and received Rituximab as \\nabove. Prior to discharge, patient\\x92s respiratory failure has \\nresolved and he was satting well on room air. \\n\\n#Fluid overload: \\nThroughout the hospital course, Mr. ___ required significant \\ndiuresis due to retention f fluid in the gut and extremities. \\nImaging also reflected pulmonary congestion which likely \\ncontributed to his respiratory status. The patient continued to \\nbe diuresed until discharge and was instructed to montitor his \\nweight daily follow discharge. \\n\\n#Hemolytic Anemia:\\nPatient prior to admission had Hgb 12.4, which was noted to \\ndowntrend. He had low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, but normal \\nretic count raising concern for hemolysis. EBV viremia \\nassociated with hemolytic anemia. Other etiologies include \\nmechanical valve associated hemolysis. Unlikely to be immune \\nmediated given negative direct coombs test. Improved with \\ntreatment of EBV as above. \\n\\n#DLBCL s/p Allo SCT: \\nDiagnosed in ___ with stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \\nwith persistent disease status post six cycles of dose adjusted \\nR- EPOCH and two cycles of salvage RICE with relapse in CAR \\nT-cells ___ s/p allogeneic transplant. Initially there was \\nconcern that recurrent fever and ___ symptoms may reflect \\nPTLD. A PET scan demonstrated diffuse FDG avid LAD consistent \\nwith EBV viremia. Review of peripheral blood smears showed \\natypical lymphocytes without the presence of lymphoma cells. His \\ntacrolimus dose was decreased to 0.5mg daily on discharge given \\nvariable metabolism of drug in the setting of illness. He was \\ncontinued on acyclovir Bactrim, and posaconazole for \\nprophylaxis. He was also continued on ursodiol for VOD \\nprophylaxis. \\n\\n#Lactic acidosis \\nOn the AM of ___, patient became acutely dyspneic and \\ntachycardic to the 130s with new oxygen requirement. A CXR \\ndemonstrated mild pulmonary congestion. Patient was noted to be \\nrigoring throughout the episode and febrile to 102. Etiology of \\nelevated lactate was unclear. Concerned that episode may be due \\nto cytokine release in the setting of EBV viremia and CT scan \\nfrom ___ showing increased splenomegaly and LAD. CRP elevated \\nto 231.7. No clear source for infectious etiology. No evidence \\nof bowel ischemia on CT abd pelvis on ___. Abdominal exam \\nlargely unchanged from prior. He was given a dose of solumedrol \\nwith down trending lactate. \\n\\n#Diarrhea: \\nDuring hospitalization, he developed significant diarrhea. C. \\ndiff was sent on several occasions as well as a bacterial, viral \\nand parasitic stool workup. These tests were all negative. \\nDiarrhea was attributed to malabsorption from gut edema in the \\nsetting of EBV viremia. \\n\\n#Euvolemic Hyponatremia:\\nDuring hospitalization, patient developed hyponatremia. Urine \\nosmolality significantly elevated to >500. In the setting of \\nfulminant EBV viremia and pneumonia, hyponatremia was thought to \\nbe due to SIADH. By discharge, the hyponatremia was resolving. \\n\\n#Transaminitis: \\nPatient was noted to have rising AST over several days. Given no \\nabnormalities in ALT, it was thought that the elevation was \\nlikely reflective of stress induced transaminitis. \\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n=========================\\n#HTN:\\nHe was continued on his home regimen of amlodipine and \\nmetoprolol however his metoprolol was fractionated while he was \\nin the hospital given his tenuous clinical status. \\n\\n#HISTORY OF MECHANICAL AVR: Goal ___. \\nOn presentation, INR was therapeutic. Warfarin was held in the \\nsetting of worsening clinical status. He remained off of \\nwarfarin for the majority of his hospitalization as his INR \\nremained therapeutic. He was restarted on warfarin at 5mg once \\nhis INR became subtherapeutic. The team discussed with the \\npatient the desire to bridge him to warfarin with lovenox but he \\nrefused. He was discharged home with instructions to follow up \\nin ___ clinic. \\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n=========================\\n[] On ___, he will need count checks, tacrolimus level, INR, \\nEBV, BK, and CMV VL. \\n[] He will need repeat PET scan. \\n[] Evaluate for resolution of bowel LAD and edema.\\n[] Repeat B-D-glucan as outpatient                                                \\t___ is a 43 year old M presenting to the ED with Hematuria, ILI. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Hematology/Oncology Intermediate and then visited Emergency Department. Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Other specified sepsis, Other viral pneumonia, Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia, Stem cells transplant status, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, lymph nodes of multiple sites, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Acquired hemolytic anemia, unspecified, Acidosis, Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, Severe sepsis without septic shock, Fluid overload, unspecified, Thrombocytopenia, unspecified, Other cystitis with hematuria, Diarrhea, unspecified, Nonspecific elevation of levels of transaminase and lactic acid dehydrogenase [LDH], Essential (primary) hypertension, Presence of prosthetic heart valve in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the

Per PCP notes, HTN \\nongoing and poorly since ___ with BP usually ~200/140 at clinic \\nor ED visits. BP managed with labetolol 100mg TID and eventually \\namlodipine 10mg daily while admitted. Losartan was held (and \\nshould continue to be held as an outpatient until normalized \\nrenal function) in the setting of acute kidney injury. BP in \\n140s-160s/80s-100s range by the time of discharge. \\nDISCHARGE MEDS: amlodipine 10mg daily, labetolol 100mg TID. \\nLosartan HELD.\\n\\n#HEMATURIA:\\n#PYURIA:\\n#PROTEINURIA:\\n___: Creatinine of 3.0 on admission, baseline is 0.7 as of \\n___. Initial UA showed moderate blood + 10 RBCs and \\n>100 protein. Urine sediment with WBC casts and many RBCs \\nwithout dysmorphic features. Repeat UA on ___ showed \\nresolved hematuria and proteinuria. Rare eosinophils were \\npresent in this sample. Leading diagnosis continues to be \\ndrug-induced acute interstitial nephritis; eosinophils in urine \\nare supportive of this. Suspected cause if single dose of \\nibuprofen and ranitidine. Differential was otherwise broad, \\nincluding HIV nephropathy (negative HIV antibody this \\nadmission), lupus nephritis (normal complement levels, no other \\nsigns/symptoms of lupus), Wegener\\'s granulomatosis (no other \\norgans/areas affected), and RPGN (RBCs in urine resolved, no \\ndysmorphic RBCs). Hypertensive nephrosclerosis and diabetic \\nnephropathy were felt to be unlikely given the acute decline in \\nrenal function and urine sediment findings. Pt was evaluated by \\nnephrology, who agreed that this was most likely AIN. Decision \\nwas made to start patient on prednisone 80mg daily for a 14 day \\ncourse, to presumably shorten duration of AIN and prevent \\nfurther complication. Pt\\'s creatinine steadily improved \\nthroughout admission, eventually down to 1.9 at the time of \\ndischarge. Labs to assess for vasculitis, autoimmune diseases \\nwere sent, and were still pending at the time of discharge ___, \\nANCA, ASO). Going forward, pt should STRICTLY AVOID NSAIDs and \\nH2 blockers, as well as PPIs to prevent another episode of AIN.\\n\\n#ACUTE EPIGASTRIC PAIN: Likely viral gastroenteritis, resolved \\nupon admission to floor. Avoid H2 blockers and PPIs, given AIN.\\n\\n#DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: Poorly controlled, with most recent \\nA1C of 11.8 in ___. Reports poor adherence to glipizide. \\nFSBGs 170s-190s during admission. Managed with sliding scale \\ninsulin. Glucose increased to 300 after starting prednisone. \\nDecision was made to put patient on long-acting insulin, at \\nleast while he is on prednisone. Discharged on 10U lantus daily, \\nfollowing insulin education while still admitted. Will be \\nongoing issue as an outpatient; will likely need medication \\ntitration to achieve better glycemic control.                                                \\t___ is a 32 year old M presenting to the ED with Epigastric pain, N/V.

She was \\npreviously admitted @ ___ from ___ - ___ for \\nmedical stabilization ___ anorexia but left AMA after her \\ntransfer to ___ was delayed. She then came to ___ (stated \\nshe did so because she receives most of her care here). During \\nhospitalization at ___, she had been refusing lab draws, IVF, & \\nPO intake.\\n\\nUpon admission, the patient was markedly orthostatic w/ standing \\nSBP in ___. She also had an anion-gap metabolic acidosis ___ \\nstarvation w/ HCO3 of 10, pH 7.31, & positive urinary ketones. \\nShe was admitted for medical stabilization & initiation of \\neating disorder protocol. \\n\\nACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED\\n\\n# Eating disorder\\n# Severe Malnutrition\\nStated she had not eaten in 14 days prior to admission. She was \\nevaluated by Psychiatry & Nutrition on admission & started on \\nthe medically unstable eating disorder protocol given acute \\nelectrolyte disturbances (HCO3 10), orthostatic hypotension, and \\n30-lb weight loss since ___. She failed her first solid & \\nliquid meals and subsequently refused NG tube placement. \\nAlthough she realized the danger of her behavior, her inability \\nto adjust her behavior rendered her w/o capacity so guardianship \\nwas sought. A ___ line was placed in the interim and she was \\nresuscitated w/ IVF, thiamine, & electrolyte replacements. On \\n___ emergency guardianship was obtained and Dobbhoff tube \\nwas placed (patient was very upset about this, patient placed \\ntube herself, refused MD placement). On ___ the Dobbhoff was \\nadvanced to the postpyloric position by ___ -- this was done \\nbecause the patient explains that she cannot tolerate gastric \\ntube feeds due to her history of gastroparesis. On ___ tube \\nfeeds were initiated. Initiation of feeds required security at \\nthe bedside and wrist restraints (were removed shortly after pt \\ncalmed down and tolerated). As her nutrition continued to \\nimprove, her mental status cleared and she was more logical, \\nrational, and able to participate in her care. She responded \\nmuch better to a less restrictive treatment plan, which allowed \\nfor one coffee a day, three decaf teas a day, and unlimited \\neating (unfortunately she never requested to eat anything). It \\nshould be noted that if she has future hospitalizations, that \\nthis approach is much better than the strict eating-disorder \\nprotocol. However, she continued to have low frustration \\ntolerance at times, and she pulled out her NG tube during a team \\nmeeting on ___. A GJ-tube ___ Fr low profile MIC) was placed \\nby ___ on ___. She had significant abdominal pain after this \\n(see elsewhere in ___ summary for details). Tube feeds at 50cc/hr \\nand 100cc water flushes Q4H were tolerated. Patient declined to \\nattending eating disorder program at this point. She was \\ndischarged with support to continue tube feeds at home while \\nalso following closely with her new therapist ___ \\n___, her nutritionist ___ (___), \\nand her primary care doctor, ___ \\n(___). \\n\\n# Abdominal pain\\nSignificant abdominal pain following placement of GJ tube. Tube \\nstudy w contrast showed correct tube placement and patency, and \\nKUB with no evidence of obstruction. Abdominal US showed some \\nhypo-echoic area but no discrete fluid collection, low suspicion \\nfor infection given no fevers, overlying skin changes, or \\nleukocytosis. GI consulted, recommended to remove the T-tacks \\naround the tube which were . CTA/P with some reactive changes \\naround GJ tube insertion, and e/o ruptured ovarian cyst. Held \\ntube feeds per patient request for two days over the weekend, \\nwith some . After meeting on ___, restarted tube feeds with \\nunderstanding that they will likely cause patient discomfort and \\npain, but we will treat these as best as we can, and that we \\nhave done thorough work-up to eliminate any other causes of \\nabdominal pain. \\n\\n# UTI\\nUA with large leuks and many bacteria. Urine culture grew Group \\nB Strep. This was treated with nitrofurantoin 100mg bid x5 days \\n(___). \\n\\n# Anemia, multifactorial \\nHgb on presentation was on the lower-end of normal (11.3) and \\nfell steadily during admission. Iron studies not consistent with \\niron deficiency anemia. Vitamin B12 and folate normal. \\nReticulocyte count inappropriately low. Labs not consistent with \\nhemolysis. No evidence of bleeding. Etiology of anemia felt to \\nbe multifactorial, with contributions from phlebotomization, \\nmenorrhagia, anemia of chronic inflammation, all in the setting \\nof insufficient erythropoiesis due to malnutrition. \\n\\n# Orthostatic hypotension\\nDuring orthostatic vitals patient is persistently tachycardic to \\nthe 130s-140s, hypotensive to the systolics of ___, and is \\noften symptomatic with dizziness upon standing. Of note patient \\nalso has history of POTS. Treated with IV fluids, improved with \\nincreased nutrition and exertion tolerance. \\n\\n# AGMA\\nKetoacidosis ISO starvation. We monitored HCO3 & pH daily, both \\nof which improved w/ hydration.\\n\\n# PICC-associated DVT\\nFound on prior hospitalization. Continued apixaban for 3-month \\ncourse (end-date ___. Notably there was some swelling around \\nthe ___ site; ultrasound was negative for DVT in this area.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n\\n# Psychiatry\\nCarries diagnoses of unspecified mood disorder, OCD, PTSD. We \\ncontinued home prazosin, lorazepam, trazadone. \\n\\n# Gastroparesis: Continued home mesalamine + promethazine. \\n\\n# Asthma: No PFTs on file. Continued albuterol PRN. Continued \\nhome cetirizine. \\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n[] In case of emergency, needing psychiatric help, or other \\nissues, please don\\'t hesitate to call ___ Emergency Services \\nTeam (BEST) ___\\n[] Please encourage use of multi-vitamin\\n[] Discharged with 4 days of oxycodone for ongoing abdominal \\npain from GJ tube placement. Would continue to wean given risk \\nfor ileus with prolonged use \\n[] Would avoid giving both cetirizine and hydroxyzine given that \\nactive metabolite of hydroxyzine is cetirizine. \\n[] When more nutritionally stable, should follow-up with \\nendocrine ___, MD) clinic to assess her ACTH, \\ncortisol, and TFTs                                                \\t___ is a 22 year old F presenting to the ED with Weakness.

setting of port placement, \\nand was found to have a L pneumothorax. A pigtail chest tube was \\nplaced in the ED. She tolerated the procedure well without \\ncomplications (Please see Thoracic surgery consult note for \\nfurther details). She was admitted to the Colorectal surgery \\nservice for further management. She was stable overnight, and \\nher chest tube was clamped, and then discontinued without issue. \\nXray confirmed reduction in her pneumothorax. Thoracic surgery \\nservice was comfortable with discharge to home. \\n\\nNeuro: The patient was given oral pain medications as needed. \\nStable from a neurological standpoint.\\n\\nCV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; \\nvital signs were routinely monitored.\\n\\nPulmonary: Respiratory status was stable after placement of the \\nchest tube. She tolerated water seal and discontinuation of the \\nchest tube without complication. Chest xrays were performed to \\nconfirm stability of her pneumothorax after each manipulation of \\nthe chest tube.\\n\\nGI/GU: She tolerated a regular diet. Intake and output were \\nclosely monitored.\\n\\nID: The patient\\'s temperature was closely watched for signs of \\ninfection.\\n\\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during \\nthis stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as \\npossible.\\n\\nOn ___, the patient was discharged to home. At discharge, \\nshe was stable from a respiratory and hemodynamic perspective. \\nShe will follow-up in the clinic in ___ weeks. This information \\nwas communicated to the patient directly prior to discharge. \\n\\nInclude in Brief Hospital Course for Every Patient and check of \\nboxes that apply:                                                \\t___ is a 33 year old F presenting to the ED with Chest pain, CONCERN FOR PTX. Over the course of her hospital course, ___ started at Hematology/Oncology and then visited Emergency Department. Over the course of their hospital stay, her was given the following diagnoses: Iatrogenic pneumothorax, Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon, Acquired absence of intestine (large) (small), Other specified procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at time of procedure, Accidents occurring in residential institution in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures: Insertion of intercostal catheter for drainage in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications: Midazolam at 2142-04-06 15:38:00, HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) at 2142-04-06 17:04:00\\n62061\\t62077\\t25099750\\t___ gentleman with PMH significant for recurrent lower GI bleed \\nwith known internal hemorrhoids, chronic ischemic injury of \\nanastomotic site, diverticular disease and angioectasias, and \\nmechanical AVR on anticoagulation presented with blood stool and \\nsupratherapeutic INR that resolved without intervention..\\n  \\n# Lower GI Bleed: Pt. presented with several days of \\nhematochezia in setting of supratherapeutic INR. This has been a \\nrecurrent problem for the patient and is likely exacerbated by \\nhis need for long-term anticoagulation. Pt. has known internal \\nhemorrhoids, diverticulosis, small bowel lymphangioectasia, and \\nischemic injury of the anastamotic site from prior left \\nhemicolectomy. Any of these sites could have been potential \\nsource of bleeding. Pt. received 1U PRBC while in the ED due to \\nconcern for active blood loss.  He remained hemodynamically \\nstable, however, throughout the admission. Bloody stools \\nself-resolved without intervention other than downtrending of \\nINR. GI was involved and agreed that further colonoscopy was not \\nindicated. By time of discharge, he was having normal brown \\n(albeit heme positive) stools and remained asymptomatic.   \\n\\n# Troponemia:  On admission, pt. had elevated trop to 0.___epression in precordial leads. Pt. not actively \\nsymptomatic on presentation, though did report some chest \\ntightness the night prior.  Troponin was downtrending at next \\ncheck. Elevated troponin felt to most likely be secondary to CHF \\nexacerbation given that pt. was hypervolemic on admission with \\nelevated BNP and had recently decreased his furosemide dose. Pt. \\nhimself had noticed increased dyspnea and lower extremity edema \\nand had actually increased his furosemide himself the day prior \\nto admission.  Pt. was continued on furosemide 80mg PO daily \\nwith appropriate response and improvement in dyspnea and lower \\nextremity edema.\\n\\n# AVR s/p mechanical valve: Pt. with mechanical valve in place \\nneccesitating lifelong anticoagulation. INR was supratherapeutic \\non admission, therefore warfarin was initially held in setting \\nof GI bleed. INR rapidly fell, however, and became \\nsubtherapeutic.  Pt. was started on enoxaparin as bridge to \\ntherapeutic INR.  He was discharged on enoxaparin with close \\nfollow-up.\\n \\n# Anemia: Pt. with known chronic anemia likely multifactorial in \\netiology including chronic and acute GI bleeds and hemolysis \\nfrom mechanical aortic valve.  Pt.\\'s anemia remained stable \\nafter initial transfusion in the ED.\\n \\n# Acute on chronic kidney diease: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on \\nadmission from baseline of around 1.4.  We suspected this was \\nrelated to CHF exacerbation.  Creatinine improved slowly with \\ndiuresis.\\n\\n# CHF with preserved EF: Secondary to severe leak around aortic \\nvalvce. Pt. was continued on torsemide and carvedilol. \\nLisinopril was initially held in setting ___ but was \\nrestarted on discharge.\\n\\n# Hypothyroidism: Pt. continued on home levothyroxine.\\n \\n# Transitional Issues:\\n- Lovenox bridge to continue until INR therapeutic (___). Repeat \\nINR due ___.\\n- CODE:  FULL\\n- CONTACT:  ___ (girlfriend) ___ (h), \\n___ (c)                                                \\t___ is a 46 year old M presenting to the ED with BRBPR, Chest pain.

distant PE, and cutaneous vasculitis who \\npresents after recent admission for ARF, with leukocytosis and \\nleft flank pain.\\n\\n#Antiphospholipid syndrome: patient presented after being off \\nanticoagulation for a biopsy of his left kidney due to ARF found \\non previous admission. This biopsy was complicated by \\nperinephric hematoma. With a hematoma, there was a concern about \\nrestarting anticoagulation, even though noncontrast CT \\nabdomen/pelvis showed some improvement of the hematoma. However, \\ngiven the finding of a left renal vein thrombus (see below), the \\ndecision was made to start anticoagulation with a heparin drip. \\nInterventional radiology and transplant surgery were consulted, \\nand agreed to proceed with medical anticoagulation. It was felt \\nthat the benefits of anticoagulation in the setting of a left \\nrenal vein thrombus and a history of DVTs and PEs outweighed the \\nrisk of bleed, and so heparin drip was started. Due to his \\nunderlying APLS, his PTT is elevated at baseline. His heparin \\ndrip was guided by unfractionated heparin (anti-factor Xa) \\nlevels checked q6h during his hospital course. Transitioning to \\nan oral regimen was challenging during this admission, as he was \\nfound to have an elevated INR at baseline. This was initially \\nfelt to be due to vitamin K deficiency, factor deficiency, or \\nfactor inhibitor. INR did not correct with vitamin K \\nadministration. Mixing studies revealed factor deficiency. His \\nCoumadin was then dosed based on factor II, VII, and X, with an \\nINR goal of 2.5-3.5 as an outpatient. \\n\\n#Left renal vein thrombus: Given ARF on presentation and left \\nkidney enlargement, he had a renal ultrasound that was unable to \\nvisualize the renal vein. He subsequently had an MRV that showed \\nclot to the left renal vein that crossed the midline but did not \\nextend into the IVC. This was treated with a heparin drip \\ntransitioning to Coumadin as above.\\n\\n#Acute renal failure: due to thrombotic microangiopathy seen on \\nbiopsy during previous admission as well as left renal vein \\nthrombus. Nephrology was consulted during admission and guided \\nmanagement. His creatinine on admission was 3.2 and remained \\naround ___ by the time of discharge. \\n\\n#SIRS: Patient with leukocytosis on admission and intermittently \\nfebrile with Tm 101.6 during admission. He was initially placed \\non ceftriaxone for suspected pyelonephritis given pyuria and \\npartially treated UTI in the outpatient setting. He was also \\ninitially covered with vancomycin given recent instrumentation \\nfor biopsy. His Ct abd/pelvis was concerning for infection given \\nthe enlargement of the left kidney with perinephric fat \\nstranding. However, urine cultures were negative, and his \\nleukocytosis was thought largely due to inflammation in the \\nsetting of hematomas, renal vein clot, and left kidney injury \\nwith ischemic injury. ID was consulted and felt that his \\nleukocytosis and fever were due to inflammation rather than \\ninfection and his ceftriaxone was discontinued after course from \\n___. \\n\\n#Ileus: ___ hospital course was complicated by ileus. He \\nhad a CT abd/pelvis that showed significant gaseous distension \\nof the small and large bowel. He was treated with bowel rest and \\nplaced on flagyl empirically for CDiff. Flagyl was discontinued \\nafter CDiff returned negative. Ileus was felt due to a \\nintra-abdominal inflammation and improved spontaneously.\\n\\n#Right adrenal hematoma: This admission was complicated by the \\ninterval development of a right adrenal hematoma in the setting \\nof heparin drip. As patient remained hemodynamically stable, \\nheparin drip remained on at a reduced rate. \\n\\n#Anemia: Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic \\ndisease, felt to be due to inflammation. Hemolysis labs were \\nnegative. His CT abd/pelvis done for ileus did not show \\nsignificant evidence of bleed. He received 1U pRBCs with \\nappropriate rise. He remained hemodynamically stable over the \\ncourse of his hospitalization. \\n\\n#h/o cutaneous vasculitis: patient remained on home \\nhydroxychloroquine during admission.                                                \\t___ is a 56 year old M presenting to the ED with Abnormal labs. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Discharge Lounge and then visited Vascular, Medicine, Vascular, Medicine, Emergency Department. Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Antiphospholipid syndrome, Sepsis, unspecified organism, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Embolism and thrombosis of renal vein, Contusion of adrenal gland, initial encounter, Ileus, unspecified, Tubulo-interstitial nephritis, not specified as acute or chronic, Acute posthemorrhagic anemia, Personal history of other venous thrombosis and embolism, Long term (current) use of anticoagulants, Hypothyroidism, unspecified, Personal history of pulmonary embolism, Anemia in other chronic diseases classified elsewhere,

spontaneous DVTs on coumadin \\n+ ASA presenting with headache and found to have a large IVH \\nwith source likely arising from the L thalamus. Head CT \\nperformed and showed IVH with an INR was 2.7, he was given 1 \\nunit of FFP and vit K and he was transferred to ___ for \\nfurther evaluation. He was admitted to neurosurgery and \\ntrasnferred to the ICU for close monitoring for hydrocephalus. \\nOn ___, the patient was intubated for decreased mental status, \\nhypoxia, and tachypnic to the hight ___. No surgery was planned \\nso he was transferred to the Neurology service. Etiology of the \\nbleed was thought to be ___ HTN, although an alternate etiology \\ncould such as an occult malignancy could not be excluded \\nespeically given recent recurrent DVTs.\\n\\nHe experienced progressively declining mental status after \\nintubation. Multiple CT head repeats were negative. On \\ninfectious screen he was found to have pneumonia and was started \\non Vanc/Zosyn for VAP treatment on ___. EEG showed PLEDs so he \\nwas loaded with phenytoin on ___. EEG improved after phenytoin \\nand Keppra started. Eventually his PLEDs resolved and he was \\nweaned off of both AEDs. Of note, he did have episodes of \\nshoulder tremor, L>R, which were captured on EEG and were not \\nthought to be seizures. He was started on amantadine for \\nneurostimulation, which was switched to modafanil as amantadine \\ncan potentially cause seizures and hypotension. His neurologic \\nexam showed some minor improvements with the patient begining to \\nwithdraw the left arm to noxious stimuli (on occasion) and he \\nbegan to have brisk withdrawal (triple flexion) to noxious \\nstimuli in the BLE. He occasionally opened his eyes slightly to \\nvoice.\\n\\n#ID - febrile and started on vanc/zosyn for VAP on ___. on ___ \\nhe underwent bronchoscopy, BAL w PMNs, no organisms on grain \\nstain. LP showed elevated WBC 106, switched zosyn to cefepime, \\nstarted on ampicillin to cover listeria, acyclovir for HSV. \\nHowever, csf leukocytosis then thought to be secondary to bleed \\nand antibiotics were discontinued on ___. He continued to be \\nintermittently febrile, and on ___ he became hypotensive and \\nwas again started on broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin \\nand cefepime for conern of sepsis. Repeat infectious work up \\nincluding blood and urine cultures did not reveal infectious \\nsource. BAL was obtained and did not show any growth of \\npathogenic organisms on culture. Therefore antibiotics were \\nstopped on ___.\\n\\n#RESPIRATORY: He had respiratory decompensation requiring \\nintubation. There was a question of PE causing respiratory \\ndecompensation however as early on in the course of his bleed he \\nwas not going to be a candidate for coumadin, CTPA was not \\npursued (also with chronic renal failure). Therefore, IVCF was \\nplaced on ___. He remained intubated until trach and PEG were \\nplaced on ___. He continued to require the ventilator for \\nrespiratory support.\\n\\n#RENAL: Mr. ___ kidney function remained stable with a \\ncreatinine ranging from 2.0-2.8 and BUN in the ___. He did \\nnot require dialysis. \\n\\n#HEME: On ___ duplex ultrasound revealed DVTs in the LUE. Head \\nCT was obtained which showed expected evolution of the previous \\nIPH and no active bleeding. He was therefore started on a \\nheparin gtt with a bridge to coumadin. Coumadin dose has been \\ngradually increased from 5 to 10mg daily.\\n\\n#CV: For tachycardia, he was initially started on metoprolol, \\nswitched to labetalol for goal systolic blood pressures 100-160. \\nHe was thought to be volume overloaded, and was given lasix PRN \\nand also a lasix gtt from ___.

TTE on ___ showed no evidence of right \\nheart strain and troponin was negative. Normally a CTA would be \\nobtained but given the recent contrast load, this would be \\nincreased risk.  In addition, without evidence of right heart \\nstrain, even if additional PEs were found, it was not thought to \\nchange management.  She did undergo lower extremity Doppler \\nultrasound which showed bilateral lower extremity DVTs.  The \\nblood clots were likely provoked in the setting of recent \\nsurgery, inflammation from necrotizing pancreatitis and \\nprolonged immobility while hospitalized.  She underwent a \\nheparin to lovenox bridge and will continue lovenox BID.\\n\\n# Infected, Walled-off Pancreatic Necrosis\\nPreviously hospitalized for necrotizing pancreatitis c/b sepsis.\\nHad CT abdomen/pelvis done for routine OP f/u on ___, notable\\nfor increasing size of acute necrotic collection, as well as a\\nnew SMV compression. GI performed cyst gastrostomy (___) for \\nthe pancreatic WON as\\nthe outside drain did not seem to be adequately draining the \\ncollection. Patient was started on cefepime and flagyl as EGD \\nteam reported purulent fluid seen during procedure. Follow-up \\nnon-contrast CT done three days after cyst gastrostomy placement \\nshowed decrease in size of the fluid.   Culture of the \\n___ collection did not grow any bacteria.  ID \\nrecommend transition to oral Cipro at discharge.  She will be \\nfollowed as an outpatient regarding the duration of antibiotic \\ntreatment by both GI and ID.  QTc on citalopram and \\nciprofloxacin 414/434. She will have repeat imaging in two weeks \\nto re-assess collection. \\n\\n# SMV compression, SMV thrombus, Splenic vein thrombus\\nLikely developed sub acutely in setting necrotizing \\npancreatitis.  Note: CT Abd/Pelvis going back to ___ shows \\nlongstanding complete thrombosis of the splenic vein.  Per \\nRadiology, there are collaterals to the portal vein which is \\npatent.  Surgery was consulted and did not recommend any \\nsurgical intervention.  Anticoagulation as above.  She should \\nhave age appropriate cancer screening though these thrombi are \\nlikely in the setting of pancreatitis.\\n\\n# Asymptomatic VRE bacteriuria\\nPt had urine culture from ___ grow VRE on ___ and was\\ninitially started on oral linezolid on ___.  At the time, she \\nwas unable to\\ntolerate PO dosing (would constantly vomit up pills per \\nnursing), so she was\\ntransitioned to IV linezolid on ___, after PICC was placed.\\nHowever, given lack of symptoms reported by patient, we did not \\ncontinue treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria.

He was a \\nrestrained driver who had a hypoglycemic episode and hit another \\nvehicle.  He was transferred from an OSH with a C2 dens \\nfracture.  At ___, he was seen by Neurosurgery, who fitted him \\nwith an Aspen neck collar.  He also had a CT abdomen/pelvis \\nwhich did not show any further injuries.  On HD1, he developed \\nblood at the meatus.  U/a showed many RBC in his urine.  \\nSubsequent CT cystogram showed no bladder injury.  He was then \\ntransferred to the medicine service for further care.\\n\\n# C2 Dens Fracture: Patient sustained this fracture s/p MVA \\nlikely secondary to hypoglycemia. Neurosurgery saw the patient \\nand did not recommend any surgical intervention. Aspen collar \\nwas recommended at all times. Will f/u w/ Dr. ___ in 6 weeks \\nwith repeated images of the cervical spine. On the evening of \\n___, patient became delirious and removed J collar and acute \\nchange to neck CT of increased anterior displacement and \\nsignificant soft tissue swelling. Neuro exam remained stable. No \\nnew surgery reccs per NSGY, follow-up as initially prescribed in \\n6weeks with CT prior to appointment. Both ___ and OT recommended \\n___ rehab. \\n\\n#Hypoglycemia: On the scene of the accident, patient\\'s glucose \\nwas 30. He has recently had some weight loss, but was still \\ntaking 30Units of Lantus twice daily. His evening Lantus was \\ndecreased first to 18 units, but patient with episode of glucose \\nto 34 ___, patient was dizzy and nauseous. Quickly corrected \\nwith breakfast and repeat glucose was 109. At this point, he was \\nalso experincing acute kidney injury likely leading to increased \\nlength of action for Lantus. Lantus was then completely \\ndiscontinued and a sliding scale only was used to control blood \\nsugars. He ranged from needing typically ___ units of humalog \\ncoverage per day, without lantus for a fasting blood sugar goal \\nof 150-170. \\n\\n#Delirium: Patient became delirious the evening his foley was \\ndiscontinued. He had multiple risk factors for this including \\nseveral days in the hospital, age, time of day and unfamiliar \\nenvironment (changed rooms). He received 5mg haldol overnight \\nfor acute agitation after removal of Jcollar. A post-void \\nresidual measured the next day was about 700cc, so a foley was \\nattempted. The first attempt failed and urology PA was able to \\nplace an ___ coude catheter. After his bladder was decompressed, \\nhis delirium resolved.\\n\\n#Hematuria: Episode of hematuria prior to transfer to medicine \\nfrom surgery, likely ___ foley trauma. However given high impact \\n___ was prudent to exclude bladder injury.  CT urethrogram \\nwithout any evidence of bladder injury, Thus hematuria likely \\nrealted to foley insertion trauma. It resolved quite quickly and \\ndid not recur. \\n\\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia ___ multiple myeloma, but \\nhad an acute Hct drop from 28->22. Had an episode of hematuria \\nand thought not likely to be contributed to dilution related to \\nlimited fluids. Received 1U PRBCs with appropriate rise in Hct, \\nnow stable at ___. However, with repeat C-spine CT after \\npatient removed Jcollar, there was evidence of hematoma behind L \\nSCM that had expanded since initial CT, which is likely another \\nreason for Hct drop. No evidence for continued or rapid \\nexpansion.\\n\\n___: Creatinine with an abrupt increase from 1.6->2.4, likely \\nrelated to hypovolemia with end-organ dysfunction. Also \\ncompounded by possible contrast induced nephropathy from primary \\ntrauma survery, in addition to his MM. Received a total of \\napprox 4.5L. Creatinine has improved back to baseline of \\n1.5-1.6.\\n\\n#Hand edema: Patient with swollen left hand, history of PE, \\nconcern for upper extremity DVT. Patient also has a history of \\nrequiring lasix for edema periodically. Left upper extremity \\ndoppler is negative. Edema likely exacerbated related to fluid \\nresuscitation. Would continue to elevate extremity.\\n \\n#Syncope:  Patient was noted in the field to have hypoglycemia \\nto ___.  Patient has hx of symptomatic hypoglycemia in the past. \\nPatient has lost significant amount of weight so insulin \\nrequirement is decreased compared with prior.  Levemer was \\ndecreased from 30u to 22u with increase in his ___.  Unlikely \\nthat is LOC is from malignant arrhthymia given that patient has \\nbeen on telemetry without evidence of significant arrythmia.  At \\nthis time would favor not performing TTE given high likelihood \\nthat this is due to hypoglycemia. He was not monitored on \\ntelemetry for entire admission. No other syncopal events. Refer \\nto DM for further course.\\n\\n#IDDM: Discontinued all lantus. Was managed on a sliding scale \\nand requiring only ___ daily. Would continue to monitor \\ninsulin requirements and then try oral hypoglycemics, or one \\nsmall daily dose of lantus. \\n\\n# Multiple myeloma: On velcade/dex every other week.  ___ \\ncontribute to bone disease, however no acute indication for \\nfurther workup. Remained stable.\\n\\n# CAD s/p PTCA and stent x3 (several years ago, at ___: No \\nevidence of ischemia at this time.  No medication changes \\nneeded.\\n\\n# Asthma: No evidence of acute exacerbation at this time. \\nContinued home medications. \\n\\n# hx of Diverticulitis: No evidence of diverticulitis at this \\ntime.  No intervention necessary.                                                \\t___ is a 80 year old M presenting to the ED with MVC. Over the course of his hospital course, ___ started at Med/Surg/Trauma and then visited Med/Surg/Trauma, Emergency Department. Over the course of their hospital stay, his was given the following diagnoses: Closed fracture of second cervical vertebra, Acute kidney failure, unspecified, Multiple myeloma, without mention of

Initially, we \\nwere concerned for infection, given possible pneumonia at right \\nlung base and recent ERCP, so patient was started on Levoquin \\nand Flagyl. EKG on ___ showed new poor R wave progression, and \\ntroponins were elevated, which is consistent with a Type 2 \\nNSTEMI. Patient was treated with aspirin and metoprolol. \\nPalliative ___ and hospice both helped with symptomatic \\nmanagement of pain, nausea, and urinary retention, and helped \\ncoordinate counseling on overall goals of ___. \\n\\nACTIVE ISSUES\\n\\n# End stage pancreatic cancer, with metastases to liver, \\nadrenals, and peritoneum\\nPatient\\'s family applied for hospice ___ just before this \\nhospitalization. Palliative ___ and hospice ___ were both \\nconsulted, appreciate their recs. Also communicated with \\npatient\\'s PCP, and appreciate her involvement.

Given normal \\nMB, and downtrending troponins from ___, this was most \\nlikely an MI that occurred prior to admission. Clinically, \\nnausea is improving. There was acute need for intervention, as \\nlikey a Type 2 NSTEMI without thrombus.

However, patient did not present \\nwith acute abdominal pain, and lipase levels were normal. \\nPatient did not meet SIRS criteria, and had normal lactate on \\nadmission, which was reassuring against sepsis. Considered \\nbacterial peritonitis, since patient\\'s abdomen was more \\ndistended than at baseline, and CT abdomen showed more ascites \\nthan prior imaging. Nausea & vomiting secondary to pneumonia was \\nalso considered, as he had new CT findings of bilateral pleural \\neffusions and a consolidation at right lung base. We also \\nconsidered obstruction vs ileus, as CT showed moderate stool \\nburden. Patient had normal bowel movements at home and in \\nhospital though. Blood and urine cultures both negative, patient \\nremained afebrile, so antibiotics were pulled by ___.\\n\\n# Malignant ascites: \\nOn admission, patient\\'s daughter reported that his abdomen was \\nmore distended than usual. CT abdomen showed increased ascites \\ncompared to prior imaging. Over the course of hospitalization, \\nabdomen because increasingly distended and painful. ___ performed \\nparacentesis on ___, which showed no bacterial peritonitis. 2L \\nwere taken off, with pain relief.\\n\\n4.) Urinary Retention:\\nFoley was placed on ___ due to urinary retention. Renal U/S \\nshowed a decompressed bladder with foley in place.

At baseline, patient has end \\nstage dementia, and requires assistance for ADLs. It is \\ndifficult to assess how far off he is from baseline. On \\nadmission, he was very lethargic, but responds appropriately to \\nquestions. Daughter feels like this is a change from baseline. \\nPossible causes include infection, delirium, and worsening \\ndementia. He is at very high risk for delirium. He was kept on \\ndelirium precautions, and became more alert throughout \\nadmission. \\n\\n# History of Alzheimers: Severe dementia at baseline, with \\ncomponent of anxiety.

Given the need for an LP and to elicit patient \\ncooporation, patient was treated with oxycodone ___ Q4h as \\nneeded as well as his home gabapentin. At numerous times during \\nhospitalization, he attempted to escalate pain regimen, \\nrequesting additional doses, which were denied. At discharge, \\npatient was not provided with any narcotics and recommended to \\nfollow up with PCP or at ___ pain clinic to further ellucidate the \\norigin of his pain.\\n\\n# Rash: Patient presented with ___ new rashes on his knees, \\nbilaterally, and foot.

fibrillation on \\nwarfarin, history of right MCA stroke ___ with left \\nhemiparesis), recent embolic basal ganglia infarct (___), \\nhypertension who presented from her nursing home with change in \\nmental status and non-responsiveness.\\n\\n# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: Presumed to be due to \\ninfection given clear CT head and clinical presentation \\n(febrile, history of UTI, positive UA). Presentation (O2 \\nrequirement, tachypnea, CXR) also suggested a possible \\npneumonia, so the patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn \\nand completed an 8 day course. She had minimal improvement after \\nseveral days of antibiotic therapy so neurology was consulted \\nand a 24 hour EEG completed, which showed no seizure activity \\nand findings consistent with encephalopathy. The patient slowly \\nimproved over her hospitalization, although her responsiveness \\ndid wax and wane, with minimal responsiveness in mornings and \\nimprovement in afternoon when she would follow commands, track \\nwith her eyes, and occasionally grunt in response to questions. \\nNeurology agreed that no further workout was required to assess \\nher encephalopathy, and that a slow recovery of function was to \\nbe expected given her history of strokes/brain substrate, age, \\netc. At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile with \\nstable vital signs. Given her inability to tolerate po with her \\ncurrent mental status, tube feeds were started for temporary \\nfeeding via post-pyloric dobhoff while awaiting recovery of her \\nability to eat with improvement in her alertness.\\n\\n# Hypertension: The patient was admitted on no \\nanti-hypertensives, but her outside records did indicate a \\nhistory of HTN treated with lisinopril, atenolol and amlodipine. \\nHer blood pressure was stably high through her early \\nhospitalzation and lisinopril was eventually restarted with good \\neffect. On discharge, her BPs were stable in the \\n130-140s/60-80s.\\n\\n# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient\\'s INR was sub-therapeutic on \\nadmission and she had HRs in the 100s. Warfarin was held given \\nNPO status and the patient was bridged with lovenox and \\nmonitored on tele. Prior to discharge, an NG tube was placed for \\ntube feeds and warfarin was restarted at her home dose of 4.0mg, \\nbut with tube feeds this dose was subtherapeutic. Dose increased \\non discharge to 6mg with plan to follow INR at rehab. Lovenox \\nwill be continued until full therapeutic effect is achieved with \\nwarfarin x 48h.\\n\\n# History of Stroke: The patient has a history of right MCA \\nstroke with residual left hemiparesis and left embolic basal \\nganglia infarct. Initial CT on admission showed no new acute \\nprocesses. Although her neuro exam was limited by \\nnonresponsiveness, a basic exam showed deficits consistent with \\nthe patient\\'s previous strokes and no new focal findings. \\nNeurology recommended that no additional brain imaging was \\nnecessary following admission.                                                \\t___ is a 91 year old F presenting to the ED with Altered mental status. Over the course of her hospital course, ___ started at Med/Surg and then visited Emergency Department. Over the course of their hospital stay, her was given the following diagnoses: Pneumonia, organism unspecified, Toxic encephalopathy, Urinary tract infection, site not specified, Late effects of cerebrovascular disease, hemiplegia affecting unspecified side, Atrial fibrillation, Dehydration, Unspecified essential hypertension, Wheelchair dependence, Unspecified vitamin D deficiency, Other abnormal glucose, Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants, Do not resuscitate status in order of importance to this admission.\\n\\nThis led to receiving the following procedures: Enteral infusion of concentrated nutritional substances in order of priority.\\n\\n___ also received the following medications: Piperacillin-Tazobactam at 2139-08-27 17:27:00, Potassium Chloride at 2139-08-27

with \\n2 days of palpitations, chest pressure, and dyspnea, found to be \\nin pAF with possible ischemic changes on pMIBI today.\\n \\n# CORONARIES:  Patient is s/p CABG x2, last cath in ___ showed \\nlargely patent vessels.  No new EKG changes, troponin negative \\nx2.  However, her chest pressure and shortness of breath were \\nconcerning for angina.  Cardiac enzymes negative x1, pMIBI \\nnormal.  She was continued on her home aspirin and statin.\\n \\n# PUMP:  Most recent echo showed preserved EF with diastolic \\nheart failure.  She has been on low dose diuresis in the past \\nwith either/both Lasix and spironolactone.  Currently euvolemic \\non exam.  Repeat echo showed LVEF 75% with hyperdynamic function \\nand increased flow across her prosthetic valve.  Continued her \\nhome diuresis with spironolactone.\\n \\n# RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of rare episodes of \\npalpitations, paroxysmal Afib.  Her initial presentation was due \\nto Afib with RVR, although she was rate controlled and \\ntransitioned to NSR shortly after admission.  She had another \\nepisode of Afib with RVR on ___, broken with 5mg IV \\nmetoprolol.  She had good rate control in predominantly NSR \\nthereafter on low-dose beta blockade.  Given her previous \\nintolerance of long-term metoprolol, we initiated a slow load of \\namiodarone with the intention of stopping the metoprolol in a \\nfew weeks.  She should also receive anti-coagulation given \\nCHADS-2 score of 3 (CHF, HTN, DM).  She had been on \\nanti-coagulation briefly in the past and initially refused this \\nmedication.  After discussion of the risk-benefit of a lack of \\ncoagulation, coumadin, and novel agents (rivaroxaban and \\ndabigatran), she chose to initiate coumadin.  The patient was \\nparticularly concerned about initiating new anti-coagulants that \\nwould require dose reduction given her renal disease.  She may \\nwish to reconsider these in future.  The first dose of coumadin \\nwas initiated prior to discharge.  These plans were discussed \\nwith her outpatient cardiologist via email.  Her primary care \\noffice was contacted the morning following discharge to initiate \\ncoumadin monitoring.\\n \\n# T2DM:  Most recent A1c 6.7% in ___.  Insulin sliding \\nscale used while inpatient.  Home medications restarted on \\ndischarge.\\n\\n# CKD:  Baseline Cr 1.4, currently 1.3.  As noted above, the \\npatient\\'s concern for her renal function influenced her decision \\nacross anti-coagulants.                                                \\t___ is a 68 year old F presenting to the ED with AF CHEST PAIN.

EKG at baseline, but mild bump in troponins.  \\nPatient was initially on heparin gtt given rise in troponins, \\nhowever this was stopped after 24 hours as thought to be demand \\nischemia. \\n   Patient was comfortable throughout admission, with oxygen \\nsaturations 98-100% on 2L NC, 88-90% on RA.  \\n\\n# Weakness- Patient had worsening weakness over 2 days prior to \\nadmission.  Thought to be related to infection, as patient had \\nurinary tract infection.  Infection treated as below, and \\npatient worked with physical therapy who felt he was most \\nappropriate for rehab.  Blood cultures had NGTD and patient was \\nafebrile throughout admission without leukocytosis.  As above, \\nunlikely decompensated CHF based on exam.  \\n\\n# Urinary tract infection- Likely cause of acute decompensation. \\n Patient empirically treated with IV ceftriaxone for positive \\nurinalysis.  Narrowed to oral cefpodoxime prior to discharge as \\nculture grew proteus sensitive to cephalosporins.  Cefpodoxime \\nwill be continued through ___ for ___AD- History of CAD s/p multiple stents.  No complaints of \\nchest pain, but as poor historian, concern for atypical \\npresentation with general malaise, nausea/vomiting, anorexia. As \\nabove, no change in EKG, mild bump in troponins, not in CKMB.  \\nPatient treated initially with heparin gtt and full dose \\naspirin, discontinued and changed to only baby aspirin given low \\nconcern for acute plaque rupture.  \\n\\n# Acute on chronic renal failure- Creatinine rising during \\nadmission.  Initially suspected to be due to decompensated heart \\nfailure, but with little evidence to support this, thought to be \\nmore related to prerenal hypovolemia in the setting of infection \\nand poor oral intake related to decreased appetite, \\nnausea/vomiting, likely precipitated by urinary tract infection. \\n FeUrea was 39% consistent with prerenal etiology.  Creatinine \\nwas downtrending on the day of discharge.  \\n\\n# Congestive heart failure- Last echo with EF ___. As above, \\nlow concern for decompensation.  Patient was continued on \\nmetoprolol succinate.  He is not on an ACE inhibitor because of \\nworsening renal function. He was initially diuresed, but then \\nfelt to be euvolemic,and so continued on home lasix 80mg po BID \\nwith metolazone 2.5mg BID.  He had subobptimal response to \\nlasix, so may be considered for torsemide as outpatient.\\n \\n# Hypothyroidism- Continued home levothyroxine 75mcg po daily\\n\\n# Depression- Continued on home mirtazapine and sertraline\\n\\n# Transitional issues-\\n- Creatinine will need to be checked on ___ to \\nensure it is improving.\\n- Please note that urine culture sensitivities are preliminary\\n- Cefpodoxime to be continued through ___ for total 10 \\ndays course\\n- Consider changing furosemide to torsemide as outpatient                                                \\t___ is a 89 year old M presenting to the ED with COUGH, WEAKNESS.

Found to \\nhave a right transverse venous thrombosis on MRV at ___.  \\nMRI features suggest that this thrombosis ight be several days \\nold (signal is bright on T1-weighted images). US of her jugular \\nvein does not show any clot in this vein. Thus, the thrombosis \\nwas restricted to the transverse sinus.\\n\\nNEURO: The patient was admitted to the stroke service. He \\nneurologic exam remained fully intact. She was started on a \\nheparin drip to prevent extension of the thrombosis. This was \\nlater transitioned to coumadin with lovenox bridge in \\nanticipation of discharge. The patient had a chest xray to \\nscreen for lung cancer given her long smoking history and lung \\ncancer could be another cause of increased coagulability. This \\nCXR showed stable changes consistent with known COPD. She was \\nalso tested for other indicators of hypercoagulability including \\nAnticardiolipin Antibody (pending) and ___ Microglobulin \\n(1.4). DDimer was elevated at 1039 but this is expected in the \\nsetting of a clot. While the patient will have the remaining \\nhypercoagulable workup as an outpatient, the cause of her clot \\nis likely the combination of smoking and estrogen \\nsupplementation.\\n\\nThe patient\\'s headache persisted while admitted. Tramadol and \\noxycodone were not helpful. The patient was started on \\ngabapentin and oral morphine for breahthrough pain which worked \\nbetter. Pain level was ___ on the morning of discharge.\\n\\nID: The patient had a low grade temp to 100.3 max while \\nadmitted. She had a clean dipstick urinalysis and no \\nleukocytosis. CXR was also not suggestive of infection. Her low \\ngrade temperature is likely due to the inflammatory reaction \\nfrom the clot.\\n\\nHEME: The patient reported \"black, tarry\" stool on the day of \\ndischarge. Rectal exam revealed no masses, and dark, guaiac \\nnegative stool.\\n \\nPSYCH: The patient has a history of anxiety. She was continued \\non all of her usual medications.
