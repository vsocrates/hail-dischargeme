He was initially seen at his PCP\\'s office where a \\nKUB was done showing distended loops of bowel concerning for \\nsmall bowel obstruction. On evaluation in the ED, CT scan of the \\nabdomen showed a complex network of ventral hernias with \\nmultiple loops of bowel incarcerated within the hernia. He was \\nadmitted to the Acute Care Surgery team for management and \\noperative discussion/planning. \\n\\nMr. ___ was taken to the OR on ___ and underwent an \\nexploratory laparotomy with bilateral rectus abdominis component \\nseparation repair of abdominal wall defect with polypropylene \\nmesh and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, \\nperformed by Dr. ___. He tolerated the procedure well without \\nany complications and was taken to the post-anesthesia care unit \\nin stable condition. At the end of the procedure, Mr. ___ had 2 \\nJP drains in the space overlaying the mesh and an NG tube for \\ndecompression of the stomach.\\n\\nIn the immediate post-operative period, Mr. ___ at an epidural \\nfor pain control and foley catheter while he had an epidural. \\nThe NG tube was removed a few days after the operation and he \\nwas started on sips of clears, awaiting return of bowel \\nfunction. However, after a few days, Mr. ___ became \\nincreasingly distended and had an episode of emesis. He was \\nagain kept NPO, started on IV fluids, and given a PCA for pain \\ncontrol temporarily. An NGT had to be placed to decompress the \\nstomach after a second episode of bilious vomiting. Once he \\nbegan passing flatus, he was started on a clear diet and diet \\nwas advanced as tolerated while he continued to pass flatus. \\nDuring the recovery period, he was also started antibiotics for \\nsome mild non-demarcatable erythema noted over the incision, \\nespecially given the risk of mesh infection. The JP drains \\nremained serosanguinous in output. \\n\\nOn discharge, Mr. ___ continued to pass flatus, although he had \\nnot had a bowel movement. He was tolerating a regular diet \\nwithout any nausea and vomiting and continued on a bowel \\nregimen. He was eager to be discharged and acknowledge that \\nshould he not have a bowel movement in 48 hours, he should call \\nthe clinic or return to the ED. He was given instructions for \\nmedications and scheduled to follow-up early next week for \\nstaple removal and JP drain removal and then another 2 weeks \\nafter for follow-up.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\\n1.

      "During the recovery period, he was also started antibiotics for \n",
