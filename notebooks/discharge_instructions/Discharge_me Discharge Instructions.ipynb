You tolerated the procedure \\nwell and are now ready to be discharged from the hospital.   \\n\\nPlease follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and \\nuneventful recovery.\\n\\nLOWER TRANSMETATARSAL AMPUTATION DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\\nACTIVITY \\n\\x95You should keep your amputation site elevated and straight \\nwhenever possible.  This will prevent swelling of the stump and \\nmaintain flexibility in your joint.  \\n\\x95It is very important that you put no weight or pressure on \\nyour stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal \\nproperly. \\n\\x95You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if \\napplicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and \\nlearn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  \\n\\nMEDICATION\\n\\x95Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all \\nthe medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you \\nnormally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not \\ntake is on the list please discuss it with the team!  \\n\\n\\x95You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on \\ndischarge which  can be very constipating.  If you take \\nnarcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   \\nIf constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest \\nan additional over the counter laxative. \\n\\n\\x95You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for \\npain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic \\npain medication.  You should require less pain medication each \\nday.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  \\nTylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter \\nand prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you \\nare taking in a day.\\n\\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \\n\\x95You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or \\npools until you have permission from your surgeon and the \\nincision is fully healed.\\n\\x95After your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub \\nthe area. \\n\\nWOUND CARE:\\n\\x95Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that \\nthere is no pressure on the stump.    If there is no drainage, \\nyou may leave the incision open to air.  \\n\\x95Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks.  At \\nyour followup appointment, we will see if the incision has \\nhealed enough to remove the staples. \\n\\x95Before you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to \\nreplace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be \\nfully healed. \\n\\nCALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___\\n\\x95Opening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision \\n\\n\\x95Redness, swelling or warmth in your stump.\\n\\x95Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening \\nincisional/stump pain  \\n\\nNO OTHER PROVIDER, EXCEPT YOUR VASCULAR SURGEON, SHOULD \\nDETERMINE IF YOUR STAPLES ARE READY TO BE REMOVED FROM YOUR \\nSURGICAL SITE. \\n  \\nIF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE \\nVASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.   THE \\nSTAPLES/SUTURES WILL BE REMOVED IN THE OFFICE AT YOUR FOLLOWUP \\nAPPOINTMENT WHEN IT IS DETERMINED BY THE VASCULAR SURGEON THAT \\nTHE WOUND HAS SUFFICIENTLY HEALED.'"

       "\"Mr. ___ was admitted from the emergency department on \\n___. He was initially seen at his PCP's office where a \\nKUB was done showing distended loops of bowel concerning for \\nsmall bowel obstruction. On evaluation in the ED, CT scan of the \\nabdomen showed a complex network of ventral hernias with \\nmultiple loops of bowel incarcerated within the hernia. He was \\nadmitted to the Acute Care Surgery team for management and \\noperative discussion/planning. \\n\\nMr. ___ was taken to the OR on ___ and underwent an \\nexploratory laparotomy with bilateral rectus abdominis component \\nseparation repair of abdominal wall defect with polypropylene \\nmesh and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, \\nperformed by Dr. ___. He tolerated the procedure well without \\nany complications and was taken to the post-anesthesia care unit \\nin stable condition. At the end of the procedure, Mr. ___ had 2 \\nJP drains in the space overlaying the mesh and an NG tube for \\ndecompression of the stomach.\\n\\nIn the immediate post-operative period, Mr. ___ at an epidural \\nfor pain control and foley catheter while he had an epidural. \\nThe NG tube was removed a few days after the operation and he \\nwas started on sips of clears, awaiting return of bowel \\nfunction. However, after a few days, Mr. ___ became \\nincreasingly distended and had an episode of emesis. He was \\nagain kept NPO, started on IV fluids, and given a PCA for pain \\ncontrol temporarily. An NGT had to be placed to decompress the \\nstomach after a second episode of bilious vomiting. Once he \\nbegan passing flatus, he was started on a clear diet and diet \\nwas advanced as tolerated while he continued to pass flatus. \\nDuring the recovery period, he was also started antibiotics for \\nsome mild non-demarcatable erythema noted over the incision, \\nespecially given the risk of mesh infection. The JP drains \\nremained serosanguinous in output. \\n\\nOn discharge, Mr. ___ continued to pass flatus, although he had \\nnot had a bowel movement. He was tolerating a regular diet \\nwithout any nausea and vomiting and continued on a bowel \\nregimen. He was eager to be discharged and acknowledge that \\nshould he not have a bowel movement in 48 hours, he should call \\nthe clinic or return to the ED. He was given instructions for \\nmedications and scheduled to follow-up early next week for \\nstaple removal and JP drain removal and then another 2 weeks \\nafter for follow-up.\""

       "'You were admitted to the hospital for a small bowel obstruction caused by ventral hernias. After evaluation, it was determined that you needed surgery to repair the hernias and remove a portion of your small bowel. The surgery, which included an exploratory laparotomy with bilateral rectus abdominis component separation repair of abdominal wall defect with polypropylene mesh and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, was performed by Dr. ___ and went well without any complications. After the surgery, you had two JP drains placed and an NG tube for stomach decompression.\\n\\nIn the post-operative period, you had an epidural for pain control and a foley catheter. The NG tube was removed a few days after the operation, and you were started on sips of clears while waiting for your bowel function to return. However, you experienced increased distention and an episode of emesis, which required you to be kept NPO and started on IV fluids. You were also given a PCA for temporary pain control and had to have an NG tube placed again to decompress your stomach. Once you began passing flatus, your diet was advanced as tolerated, and you were started on a clear diet. Antibiotics were also started due to some mild non-demarcated erythema over your incision, considering the risk of mesh infection. The JP drains continued to have serosanguinous output.\\n\\nAt the time of discharge, you were still passing flatus but had not had a bowel movement yet. However, you were tolerating a regular diet without any nausea or vomiting and were on a bowel regimen. It is important to note that if you do not have a bowel movement within 48 hours of discharge, you should call the clinic or return to the emergency department. You were given instructions for your medications and scheduled for follow-up appointments. The first appointment, early next week, is for staple removal and JP drain removal. The second appointment, two weeks after, is for a follow-up visit.'"
