The patient visited the following wards in order: Emergency Department, Emergency Department Observation, Medicine, Discharge Lounge, Medicine, Emergency Department Observation, Medicine. Over the course of their hospital stay, ___ was given a set of diagnoses, radiology reports from consulting physicians, and a set of daily SOAP notes. Please use these SOAP notes to create a brief hospital course summary. Refer to the patient by three underscores (___). The structure of the brief hospital course summary should be:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\"\"\\r\\n[patient introduction including age, sex, chief complaints, and relevant past medical history]\\r\\n\\r\\n# Condition 1: medications, vitals, abnormal labs and cultures, and procedures pertinent to Condition 1\\r\\n# Condition 2: medications, vitals, abnormal labs and cultures, and procedures pertinent to Condition 2\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\n\"\"\"\\r\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDiagnoses (ordered by priority):\\n----------------------------\\nHyperkalemia, End stage renal disease, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 5 chronic kidney disease or end stage renal disease, Thrombosis due to vascular prosthetic devices, implants and grafts, initial encounter, Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, Long term (current) use of insulin, Dependence on renal dialysis, Type 1 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified, Type 1 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy without macular edema, Bipolar disorder, unspecified, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified, Hyperparathyroidism, unspecified, Type 1 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia, Other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure, Unspecified place or not applicable\\n\\nRadiology Reports:\\n----------------------------\\nRadiology Report #1: INDICATION:  ___ year old man with clotted fistula.Not seen previously at\\n___, no information regarding access history. // Thrombectomy.Catheter\\nplacement if unsuccessful.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  None.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  OPERATORS: Dr. ___, Interventional Radiology Fellow and Dr.\\n___, attending radiologist performed the procedure. Dr. ___\\n___ personally supervised the trainee during the key components of the\\nprocedure and has reviewed and agrees with the trainee\\'s findings.\\nANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of\\n200mcg of fentanyl and 3.5 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service\\ntime of 1 hr 35 min during which the patient\\'s hemodynamic parameters were\\ncontinuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1% lidocaine\\nwas injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site.\\nMEDICATIONS: 4000 units heparin\\nCONTRAST: 75 ml of Optiray contrast.\\nFLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 21.6 min, 19 mGy\\n\\nPROCEDURE:\\n1. Left upper extremity AV fistula fistulogram.\\n2. Axillary, subclavian and super vena cava venography.\\n3. Balloon angioplasty of outflow vein and juxta-anastomotic stenoses.\\n4. ___ balloon pull through of the arterial inflow.\\n5. Mechanical thrombolysis of the outflow vein using the Cleaner device.\\n6. Completion left upper extremity AV fistulogram.\\n\\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient outlining the risks,\\nbenefits and alternatives to the procedure. The patient was then brought to\\nthe angiography suite and placed supine on the image table with the left upper\\nextremity abducted and stabilized.\\n\\nClinical examination demonstrated a palpable, but completely thrombosed\\nfistula in the left upper extremity. Further evaluation by targeted ultrasound\\ndemonstrated a completely thrombosed fistula. The left upper extremity was\\nprepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure timeout and\\nhuddle was performed as per ___ protocol.\\nUsing ultrasound and fluoroscopy, the arterial inflow and outflow vein levels\\nwere identified and the skin was marked with a skin marker. Antegrade\\n(directed towards the venous outflow) access into the thrombosed fistula was\\nobtained under continuous ultrasound guidance using a 21G micropuncture\\nneedle. Permanent ultrasound images were saved. An 0.018 wire was then\\nadvanced easily into the outflow vein under fluoroscopic guidance. A 4.5F\\nmicropuncture sheath was advanced and used to exchange for ___ wire.  The\\nmicropuncture sheath was exchanged for a short 6 ___ sheath.  A Kumpe\\ncatheter was advanced over the wire and slowly withdrawn while injecting\\ndilute contrast to establish the distal extent of thrombus into the outflow\\nvein. Following this, the Kumpe catheter was advanced centrally, and axillary,\\nsubclavian, and SVC venography was performed. A 150cm ___ wire was then\\nadvanced via the Kumpe into the SVC for stability. Retrograde access directed\\ntowards the arterial inflow was then obtained in a similar fashion using\\ncontinuous ultrasound and intermittent fluoroscopic guidance. Permanent\\nultrasound images were saved.\\nAt this point 4000 U heparin was administered systemically.  An 8 mm balloon\\nwas advanced over the wire and balloon angioplasty was performed along the\\nlength of the outflow vein.  A significant waist was seen along the distal\\noutflow vein, which did not reduce using a Mustang balloon, but did fully\\nefface using an 8 mm Conquest balloon at 24 mmHg.\\nA Glidewire was advanced into the inflow artery from the retrograde sheath. A\\n5.5 ___ ___ balloon was advanced beyond the arterial anastomosis,\\npartially inflated and pullback was performed through the arterial anastomosis\\ninto the graft. A partially inflated 8mm balloon was then advanced forward\\nfrom the antegrade sheath to push the arterial plug through the fistula. This\\nresulted in restoration of flow and a faint thrill in the graft. A fistulogram\\nperformed from the proximal brachial artery at this point demonstrated brisk\\nflow through the fistula but segments of narrowing and irregular filling\\ndefects at the arterial inflow and along the outflow vein. Subsequently,\\nrepeat angioplasty was performed along the length of the outflow vein using a\\n8 mm balloon.\\n8 mm balloon angioplasty was again performed along the length of the outflow\\nvein.  A second area of severe stenosis was demonstrated in the fistula inflow\\n(accessed via the retrograde sheath), which was effaced using a Mustang\\nballoon at 20 mmHg.  Additionally, a cleaner device was passed along the\\nlength of the outflow vein. After additional diagnostic venography, 6 mm\\nballoon angioplasty was performed in the juxta anastomotic segment.\\nCompletion fistulogram was performed from the proximal brachial artery,\\ndemonstrating brisk flow  throughout the entire fistula  with minimal \\nresidual thrombus  but no segments of stenosis.\\nClinical exam revealed a satisfactory thrill along the length of the fistula.\\nThe sheaths were removed and hemostasis was achieved with two ___ nylon\\npursestring sutures. There were no immediate complications.\\nA postprocedure ultrasound of the graft demonstrated patent fistula with flow\\nvolumes measuring 880 cc/min.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\n\\n1. Complete thrombosis of the left upper extremity AV fistula.\\n2.  Severe (>90%) stenosis of outflow vein with improvement following\\nangioplasty to 8 mm.\\n3. Mild stenosis of the juxta-anastamotic segment (~50%), with improvement\\nfollowing angioplasty to 6 mm.\\n4. No central venous stenosis.\\n5. Postprocedure ultrasound of the graft shows a patent fistula with v olume\\nflow of 880 cc/min.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nSatisfactory restoration of flow following mechanical thrombolysis with a good\\nangiographic and clinical result.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n\\nDaily SOAP Notes:\\n----------------------------\\nSOAP NOTE #1: Subjective:\\nThe patient, a 40-year-old male, presented to the Emergency Department with hyperkalemia.

A significant waist was seen along the distal\\noutflow vein, which did not reduce using a Mustang balloon, but did fully\\nefface using an 8 mm Conquest balloon at 24 mmHg.\\nA Glidewire was advanced into the inflow artery from the retrograde sheath. A\\n5.5 ___ ___ balloon was advanced beyond the arterial anastomosis,\\npartially inflated and pullback was performed through the arterial anastomosis\\ninto the graft. A partially inflated 8mm balloon was then advanced forward\\nfrom the antegrade sheath to push the arterial plug through the fistula. This\\nresulted in restoration of flow and a faint thrill in the graft. A fistulogram\\nperformed from the proximal brachial artery at this point demonstrated brisk\\nflow through the fistula but segments of narrowing and irregular filling\\ndefects at the arterial inflow and along the outflow vein. Subsequently,\\nrepeat angioplasty was performed along the length of the outflow vein using a\\n8 mm balloon.\\n8 mm balloon angioplasty was again performed along the length of the outflow\\nvein.  A second area of severe stenosis was demonstrated in the fistula inflow\\n(accessed via the retrograde sheath), which was effaced using a Mustang\\nballoon at 20 mmHg.  Additionally, a cleaner device was passed along the\\nlength of the outflow vein. After additional diagnostic venography, 6 mm\\nballoon angioplasty was performed in the juxta anastomotic segment.\\nCompletion fistulogram was performed from the proximal brachial artery,\\ndemonstrating brisk flow  throughout the entire fistula  with minimal \\nresidual thrombus  but no segments of stenosis.\\nClinical exam revealed a satisfactory thrill along the length of the fistula.\\nThe sheaths were removed and hemostasis was achieved with two ___ nylon\\npursestring sutures. There were no immediate complications.\\nA postprocedure ultrasound of the graft demonstrated patent fistula with flow\\nvolumes measuring 880 cc/min.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\n\\n1. Complete thrombosis of the left upper extremity AV fistula.\\n2.  Severe (>90%) stenosis of outflow vein with improvement following\\nangioplasty to 8 mm.\\n3. Mild stenosis of the juxta-anastamotic segment (~50%), with improvement\\nfollowing angioplasty to 6 mm.\\n4. No central venous stenosis.\\n5. Postprocedure ultrasound of the graft shows a patent fistula with v olume\\nflow of 880 cc/min.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nSatisfactory restoration of flow following mechanical thrombolysis with a good\\nangiographic and clinical result.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n\\nDaily SOAP Notes:\\n----------------------------\\nSOAP NOTE #1: Subjective:\\nThe patient, a 40-year-old male, presented to the Emergency Department with hyperkalemia.

Troponin level was elevated.\\n\\nAssessment: Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).\\n\\nPlan: Pt was given aspirin, nitroglycerin, and started on a heparin drip. Emergent cardiac catheterization was performed revealing significant LAD blockage which was successfully stented.\\n\\n**Hospital Course:**\\n- Following catheterization, pt was admitted to the CCU for monitoring. Beta-blockers and statins were started. Vitals remained stable, and telemetry was without significant arrhythmias.\\n- Over the hospital stay, chest pain resolved, and dyspnea improved.\\n- Pt was transitioned to oral antiplatelet therapy, and heart failure education was provided.\\n- Echocardiogram showed EF of 45% with some apical hypokinesis.\\n- Pt was started on ACE inhibitor for LV systolic dysfunction.\\n\\n**Discharge Course:**\\nSubjective: On the day of discharge, pt reported significant improvement in symptoms, with no chest pain or shortness of breath. Pt expressed understanding of discharge instructions and follow-up care.\\n  \\nObjective: Vitals at discharge: BP 130/80, HR 80, O2 sat 98% on room air. \\n     \\nAssessment: Pt has recovered well from STEMI with no complications during hospitalization. Discharged in stable condition with plans for outpatient follow-up and cardiac rehabilitation.\\n\\nPlan: Pt discharged on aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, ACE inhibitor, and P2Y12 inhibitor. Lifestyle modifications were advised, including a low-sodium diet, smoking cessation, and regular exercise as tolerated. Outpatient follow-up with cardiology in 1 week and primary care physician in 2 weeks. \\n\\n---\\n\\nThis summary synthesizes information from the SOAP notes into a coherent narrative of the patient's journey from admission to discharge. It highlights key elements of the patient's care and the status at the time of each transition, providing a clear, concise, and chronological account of the hospitalization. The summary also ensures that the essential details for appropriate outpatient follow-up and continued care are captured.\""
